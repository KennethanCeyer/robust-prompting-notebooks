Forward-looking information and statements include all information and statements regarding CPP Investments’ intentions, plans, expectations, \\nbeliefs, objectives, future performance, and strategy, including sustainability-related principles, beliefs, objectives and strategy ( “Sustainability Objectives” ), as well as any other information or statements that relate to \\nfuture events or circumstances and which do not directly and exclusively relate to historical facts. Forward-looking information and statements often but not always use words such as “trend,” “potential,” “opportunity,” \\n“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “current,” “intention,” “estimate,” “position,” “assume,” “outlook,” “continue,” “remain,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve,” and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such \\nas “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may,” and similar expressions. The forward-looking information and statements are not historical facts but reflect CPP Investments’ current expectations regarding future results \\nor events. The forward-looking information and statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations, including available \\ninvestment income, intended acquisitions, regulatory and other approvals, general investment conditions and technological, political, economic, regulatory, environmental and climatic factors. Although CPP Investments \\nbelieves that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking information and statements are reasonable, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and, accordingly, readers are cautioned not to \\nplace undue reliance on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein. CPP Investments does not undertake to publicly update such statements to reflect new information, future events, and changes in \\ncircumstances or for any other reason.\\nAdditional caution regarding sustainability-related disclosures  \\nCPP Investments also cautions readers of the following regarding the statements and other disclosures in this report related to the Sustainability Objectives (collectively, “Sustainability Disclosures” ):\\n•  In establishing and implementing Sustainability Objectives, and in making Sustainability Disclosures, CPP Investments has made various assumptions, including about technological, political, economic, regulatory, \\nenvironmental and climatic factors. These assumptions are inherently subject to uncertainty and may not prove to be correct. If any of these assumptions prove incorrect, it could have a material impact on CPP \\nInvestments’ Sustainability Objectives and its ability to effectuate them.\\n•  The market practices, policies, regulations, methodologies, frameworks, criteria, taxonomies and standards (collectively, “Sustainability Standards” ) that governmental and non-governmental entities, including \\nbusinesses and civil society, use to classify, assess, measure, report on and verify Sustainability Disclosures are still evolving. Furthermore, in some cases, Sustainability Standards may not exist. Changes to or the \\ndevelopment of new Sustainability Standards may cause CPP Investments to amend, replace or restate its Sustainability Objectives and Disclosures.\\n• Technical and other terms used in this report, including those used to describe sustainability matters, are evolving, and CPP Investments’ use of such terms may change to reflect such evolution.\\n•  In making Sustainability Disclosures and in establishing and implementing its Sustainability Objectives, CPP Investments often relies on data obtained from, or methodologies established by, third parties. \\nAlthough CPP Investments believes these sources are reliable, CPP Investments has not verified all third-party data, or assessed the assumptions underlying such data, and cannot guarantee their accuracy. CPP \\nInvestments’ use of third-party data or methodologies cannot be taken as an endorsement of the third-party, its methodologies or its data. The data or methodologies used by CPP Investments in connection with \\nSustainability Disclosures may be limited in quality, unavailable or inconsistent across sectors or assets. These factors could have a material effect on CPP Investments’ Sustainability Objectives or its ability to \\neffectuate them.\\nOverview\\nPeople. Purpose.

The Office of \\nthe Chief Actuary has affirmed that the CPP will continue \\nto be there for generations to come, as it is projected to \\nremain financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years. \\nThis home-grown success story is one Canadians can be \\nproud of, particularly at a time when many other countries \\nare struggling with the financial sustainability of their national \\npension systems. \\nWith a quarter century of working for Canadians through \\nmultiple economic cycles, CPP Investments’ commitment  \\nto contributing to the financial security in retirement for  \\n22 million Canadian contributors and beneficiaries remains \\nsteadfast. The Fund has grown in 25 of our 26 years \\nmanaging the Fund, and this scaling has contributed \\nsignificantly to the CPP’s critical position in Canada’s \\nretirement system, established to serve Canadians from all \\nwalks of life. The disciplined execution of a forward-thinking \\nstrategy, by a high-performing team, drives CPP Investments \\nto keep the CPP on a solid footing for multiple generations.\\nReflecting on the past year, we once again navigated a \\ncomplex global investing environment. In 2024, nearly half \\nthe world’s population participated in national elections. \\nAt the same time, ongoing global conflicts continued to \\nheighten geopolitical tensions. The Canadian economy \\nexperienced moderating inflation, only to be disrupted by \\na trade dispute with our nation’s closest economic partner. \\nThrough all this volatility and uncertainty, the CPP,  \\nsupported by a leading investment organization, delivered  \\non its purpose. The Canadian pension system, including \\nCPP Investments, continues to be the envy of the world and \\na source of pride for all Canadians. \\nSolid results in a shifting world\\nThis year, we delivered solid returns for the Fund. In \\nfiscal 2025, the Fund’s net income (after all costs) was \\n$59.8 billion, and our one-year return was 9.3%. The Fund \\ngrew to $714.4 billion as of March 31, and it remains on \\ntrack to reach $1 trillion by 2031. Our 10-year return remains \\nsteady at 8.3%. Since we began investing, roughly three-\\nquarters of the Fund’s current assets — $492 billion — have \\ncome from net investment income generated through the \\nwork CPP Investments does on your behalf. That’s value \\ncreated through long-term, patient investing.\\nCanadians have many reasons to be proud – and the Canada Pension Plan is one \\nof them. I am pleased to report that the Fund remains secure, with an independent \\nassessment confirming it is financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years.\\nDear Contributors  \\nand Beneficiaries,\\n4  CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='Since the end of our fiscal year on March 31, economic \\nconditions have become even more challenging. \\nThreatened and implemented tariffs have diminished growth \\nexpectations, inflation remains a concern, and the market is \\npricing in a higher probability of recession.

With $114 billion in total investments, we have \\nconsistently maintained an overweight position in Canada \\nbecause we believe in its long-term potential. While we \\nmust operate globally, we are proudly Canadian and remain \\nconfident that this country is one of the best places in the \\nworld to invest.\\nOur country offers what long-term investors value most: \\nstability, transparency and opportunity. Our legal and \\nregulatory systems are strong, our institutions trusted, \\nand our democracy stable. Canada also has world-class \\ngovernance standards and one of the most respected \\nuniversity sectors in the world. \\nCanada is a global powerhouse in natural resources and \\nenergy, and CPP Investments has several significant \\ninvestments in these industries, both here at home and \\naround the world. As one of the world’s top five energy \\nproducers, Canada is recognized as a responsible and \\nreliable supplier, helping to meet rising global demand. Our \\ncountry is also the world’s largest producer of potash, a \\nleading global producer of uranium, and holds reserves of \\nnearly every critical mineral used to produce batteries. \\nRecent trade-related interventions have galvanized \\npolicymakers and industry to re-think Canadian industrial \\npolicy, aiming to make it even stronger, more independent, \\nand more resilient. As a nation, we must consider how \\nto build on these natural endowments, skilled workforce, \\nand world-class academic institutions – not just to sustain \\ngrowth but to commercialize innovation, scale high-value \\nindustries, and reward entrepreneurial ambition. I’m \\nexcited about what this could mean for CPP Investments \\nand how this could create additional domestic investment \\nopportunities for the Fund.\\nA portfolio built for the long term\\nCPP Investments has once again been recognized as \\na global success story. Global SWF, a pension industry \\nspecialist, recently released its annual ranking of pension \\nfund performance, measured on a 10-year returns basis.  \\nWe ranked second among national pension funds globally.  \\nWe also continue to outperform international benchmarks \\nfor governance and transparency. CPP Investments was \\nranked number two on the Global Pension Transparency \\nBenchmark and our rating includes a perfect score \\non governance. \\nCPP Investments has contributed to the success of  \\nthe CPP by constructing a diversified portfolio designed \\nto perform through all market cycles including the type of \\nshort-term economic volatility we are now experiencing. \\nOur fiscal year performance demonstrated this design in \\naction. Our 2024 calendar year performance – 14.2% after \\nall costs – ranks well against global pension and institutional \\ninvestors over this period. And investments in credit and \\npublic equities generated double-digit returns this fiscal \\nyear. Currencies also contributed positively to performance, \\nunderscoring the benefits of multiple sources of  \\ninvestment return. \\nWe also note that over the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, \\nthe global public equity indexes against which we compare \\nthe performance of our investment strategies performed \\nparticularly well. That is why our relative performance \\nthis fiscal year was negative 1.6% compared to our \\nbenchmark portfolios. One of the sources of the relative \\nunderperformance was a deliberate underweight against \\nU.S.-based risk assets, specifically public equity markets. \\nWe continue to believe building a diversified portfolio, \\nand avoiding overconcentration in any one geography or \\nsector, is the prudent long-term approach for managing the \\nFund. While short-term results relative to the benchmark \\nare important accountability tools, our focus remains on \\ngenerating stable, long-term risk-adjusted returns. \\nDiversification that delivers in a fragmented world\\nGeopolitical developments moved the markets throughout \\nthe year, and we expect these conditions to persist. Through \\nit all, we remain focused on understanding and managing \\nthe impacts on the portfolio. Our long-standing risk \\nmanagement frameworks are designed to address political \\nand regulatory risks and opportunities across jurisdictions. \\nIn times of heightened volatility, the value of disciplined \\ndiversification becomes even more evident.\\n 5Annual Report 2025\\n CPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='We announced over 100 transactions, both in Canada and \\nabroad, with values in excess of $100 million.

We can only deliver world-class results for \\nCanadians by integrating all our capabilities and competing \\nas one Fund, not a collection of asset classes. \\nWe continue to focus on increasing the efficiency and \\neffectiveness of the entire enterprise. We currently manage \\napproximately $140 billion more than we did just two \\nyears ago with roughly the same number of employees; \\nthis is a great example of increased productivity. We are \\ncontinuously improving cross-organizational connectivity, \\nmaking it easier for data, knowledge, and insights to freely \\nflow across the enterprise. This leads to informed, improved \\ndecision making – and ultimately, better investment \\noutcomes.

We were established to help the Canada Pension \\nPlan (CPP or the Plan) remain financially sustainable for the long \\nterm. We prudently invest the amounts the CPP transfers to us, \\nhelping to provide a foundation on which Canadians can build \\nfinancial security in retirement.\\nCPP Investments is governed by an Act of Parliament, the \\nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board Act (CPPIB Act). Under \\nthe CPPIB Act, CPP Investments has the objective to “invest \\nits assets with a view to achieving a maximum rate of return, \\nwithout undue risk of loss, having regard to the factors that may \\naffect the funding of the Canada Pension Plan.” We manage all \\namounts the CPP transfers to us in the best interests of CPP \\ncontributors and beneficiaries, helping to ensure the CPP is \\nthere for current and future generations.\\nThe total assets we manage, net of liabilities, are referred to as \\nthe “Fund”. It is critical that we manage the Fund in a way that \\nhas regard to the risks and socio-economic factors that the \\nCPP itself faces. These factors include an aging population in \\nCanada, future birth rates, employment and immigration, and \\nthe real rate of growth in employment earnings on which CPP \\ncontributions are based. To mitigate exposure of the Fund to \\nrisks related to future Canadian economic and demographic \\nconditions, we diversify our investments across the world.\\nIndependence with accountability\\nFund assets are owned by CPP Investments and are entirely \\nseparate from the assets of any government. Contributions \\nmade to the CPP by individuals and employers that are \\nnot needed to pay current CPP benefits are transferred to \\nCPP Investments. These contributions and investment returns \\ngenerated by CPP Investments support the payment of future \\nretirement benefits at the benefit levels set by the CPP’s \\ngovernment stewards.\\nUnlike Old Age Security, CPP benefits do not come from general \\ntax revenues. The money required to pay CPP benefits comes \\nfrom only two sources:\\n• Contributions from individual contributors and their employers \\nbased on employment earnings up to the maximum amount \\ncovered by the CPP; and \\n• Investment returns.\\nMost importantly, unlike taxes that go into the federal \\ngovernment’s consolidated revenue fund, CPP contributions \\nand net assets of the Fund may only be applied to meet the \\nobligations of the CPP. CPP Investments is accountable to \\nParliament and to the federal and provincial finance ministers \\nwho serve as the joint stewards of the CPP. A key aspect of our \\noverall governance framework is our experienced, diverse and \\nprofessional Board of Directors (Board). The Governor in Council \\nappoints our Board members on the recommendation of the \\nfederal Minister of Finance, following consultation with the CPP’s \\nparticipating  provinces.\\nThe CPPIB Act sets no investment directions related to \\neconomic development, social objectives or political directives. \\nWhile the federal and participating provincial governments have \\noversight of CPP Investments, they do not direct how or where \\nthe Fund is invested; we are governed by our independent \\nBoard. Our independence from government is enshrined in \\ncarefully written legislation, ensuring that we can, and do, \\noperate at arm’s length, free from political interference.\\nAmendments to the legislation that governs CPP Investments \\nrequire agreement by the federal government plus two-thirds of \\nthe provinces representing two-thirds of the population. This is a \\nhigher requirement than the requirement for making changes to \\nthe Canadian Constitution. These checks and balances protect \\nthe best interests of CPP contributors and beneficiaries, as well \\nas the independence of CPP Investments.\\nWe report to Parliament through the federal Minister of \\nFinance, who tables our annual report in Parliament. We share \\nquarterly financial statements with the federal and provincial \\nfinance ministers and publish them on our website in both \\nofficial languages.\\nAs required under the CPPIB Act, every six years, we undergo a \\nspecial examination of our systems and practices, completed by \\nan independent examiner. The most recent special examination \\nwas completed by Deloitte LLP in February 2022. In this special \\nexamination, the independent examiner provided a clean \\nopinion, concluding there is reasonable assurance that there \\nwere no significant deficiencies in the systems and practices \\nexamined. A copy of the report is available on our website. The \\nnext special examination is anticipated to be in fiscal 2028.\\nOur annual financial statements and internal control over \\nfinancial reporting are subject to external audit and subsequent \\nreview by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which \\nthen recommends their approval to the full Board.\\n10 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 12, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nTransparency\\nTo maintain public trust, CPP Investments operates in a \\ntransparent and open way, consistently demonstrating our \\ncommitment to accountability in our practices and actions. \\nWe seek to provide CPP contributors and beneficiaries a level \\nof information that will help them understand how we make \\ninvestments and manage the Fund in their best interests.

This Act increased the \\namount of retirement pensions and other benefits that will \\nbe paid for contributions made after 2018. It also increased \\nboth the rate of contributions required on earnings covered \\nby the CPP and the upper limit on covered earnings. These \\nincreases began in January 2019 and are being phased in over \\nseven years.\\nAs part of this amendment, the CPP was expanded into \\ntwo parts:\\n• The “base” CPP refers to the portion of benefits and \\ncontributions continuing at the rates used before January \\n2019; and\\n• The “additional” CPP refers to the additional benefits and the \\nadditional contributions that started in January 2019.\\nContributions to the additional CPP are set at levels so that, \\ntogether with investment income, they are expected to be \\nsufficient to fully fund the additional benefits as they accrue. \\nContributors will gradually earn additional benefits as they make \\nadditional contributions. Contributions to the base CPP are set \\nat levels which are expected to remain stable over the long term \\nwhile preserving the ratio of Fund assets to CPP expenditures.\\nThe contributions, benefits and resulting assets for the \\nadditional CPP are accounted for jointly and separately from \\nthose for the base CPP. We seek to ensure that we invest the \\nFund’s assets fairly between the two accounts while recognizing \\nthe different funding characteristics for each account.\\nCurrent and future status of the CPP and the Fund\\nThe Office of the Chief Actuary is an independent federal body. \\nEvery three years, it provides a formal review that evaluates \\nthe financial sustainability of the CPP over a period of at least \\n75 years. The review states expectations for net returns and \\ntakes into account many prospective factors, including:\\n• The base of contributors and employment earnings;\\n• The ratio of those receiving pension benefits relative to those \\ncontributing; and\\n• Anticipated changes in life expectancy.\\nThe most recent actuarial review of the CPP – the 31st Actuarial \\nReport – was conducted as at December 31, 2021 and tabled \\nin the House of Commons in December 2022. It covered both \\nparts of the CPP – the base CPP and the additional CPP.

We believe that the enduring nature of the Fund, our governance and our culture differentiate us \\nfrom many other large institutional investors. Together, these support our ability to generate value in the best interests of CPP’s \\ncontributors and beneficiaries.\\nOur inherent advantages\\nThe nature of the Fund itself carries three distinct investing \\nadvantages:\\nLong horizon – The CPP must serve Canadians for many \\ngenerations to come. As a result, the Fund has a much longer \\ninvestment horizon than most investors. We can assess the \\nprospects of our strategies and opportunities over decades, \\nnot just over quarters or years. We can withstand short-term \\ndownturns to create value over the long run. Most investors \\ntake a shorter-term approach, whether by choice or because \\nbusiness pressures force them to do so. As a result, they are \\nmore limited than CPP Investments in their ability to access or \\nretain investments where the benefits are only expected to be \\nfully realized over a longer-term horizon.\\nCertainty of assets to invest – The Fund’s future asset base is \\nlargely predictable and its pattern of cash flows into the future \\nis generally stable. As a result, we are not forced to sell assets \\nto pay benefits and we can build investment strategies with \\nconfidence. This long-term certainty of assets and cash flows \\nunderpins our ability to act as a trusted financial partner in major \\ntransactions and ongoing relationships.\\nScale – As the CPP is one of the largest retirement funds in \\nthe world, we can access opportunities globally for which only \\nthe largest institutional investors can compete. In addition, \\nour size enables us to maintain select dedicated in-house \\nteams and gain access to global external partners. Scale \\nalso allows us to develop the investment, operational and \\ntechnological capabilities required to run a cost-effective \\nglobal investing platform.\\nOur developed advantages\\nIn addition to our inherent advantages, we believe that the \\nstrategic choices we make as an organization afford us three \\nfurther key advantages:\\nInternal expertise and brand – Our expertise, local knowledge, \\nbrand and reputation allow us to access attractive opportunities \\nacross the globe, in both private and public markets. Our \\nteam, located across our global offices, seeks to create value \\nby combining best practices, depth, skill and experience to \\nmanage assets both internally and with external partners. Our \\nbrand allows us to attract, motivate and retain skilled employees \\nfrom around the world.\\nExpert partners and relationships – Through our scale and \\nother advantages, we are able to engage the specialized \\nresources and expertise of many external partners globally. \\nOur internal expertise allows us to build deep relationships with \\nthese long-term partners to maximize value for the Fund.

It \\ndoes this year-by-year over 75 years, in line with the projection \\ntimeline used by the OCA’s Actuarial Report.\\nThe analysis focuses directly on CPP Investments’ impact on \\nfuture CPP outcomes. It quantifies the potential for positive \\nand negative impacts of investment returns on future CPP \\ncontributions and benefits.

By itself, \\ndiversification tends to lower market risk. However, using \\nleverage tends to increase market risk. Using both techniques \\ntogether, we are able to construct portfolios that are broadly \\ndiversified at our targeted level of market risk, and also provide \\nopportunities to add value through active management for each \\nof the base and additional CPP. When designing our portfolios \\nwe set exposure targets which represent the desired long-term \\ndiversified asset class exposures that we believe will make the \\nportfolio more resilient to equity market downturns. The impact \\nof this decision is lower – but still attractive – returns when \\nequity markets and economic growth are strong.\\nWe believe that conventional asset classifications by themselves \\ndo not adequately capture the diverse nature of the risks to which \\neach asset class is exposed. For example, both equities and \\ncredit investments can benefit from changes in macroeconomic \\ngrowth expectations. Private and public investments may \\nappear to be fundamentally similar. However, their liquidity \\nprofile is materially different and their internal financial leverage \\nor debt level are typically not the same. Debt securities carry \\na wide range of durations and credit risk. Equities vary in their \\ngeographic, sector and financial leverage exposures.\\nGiven these variables, we have defined several key risk-return \\nfactors that are fairly distinct and underpin the returns on many \\ntypes of investments. Examples include growth risk, inflation risk \\nand real interest rate risk. We model and map our investment \\nstrategies based on the extent to which they are affected by \\nrisk-return factors. We then use our models throughout our \\nTotal Portfolio Investment Framework. For example, when we \\nconstruct portfolios we consider exposure to various risks \\nand the effects of currencies, leverage and liquidity. We also \\nrecognize the additional expected risk and return of active \\nmanagement. Given these characteristics, we can analyze \\nhow major new investments or divestments might affect the \\nexposures of the total portfolio. As markets and security \\nprices change, we rebalance our portfolios and seek to avoid \\nunintended factor and risk exposures.\\nExposure targets – the Strategic Portfolio\\nWe manage the market risk levels of each of the base \\nCPP and additional CPP Investment Portfolios to closely \\nmatch their respective targeted level of market risk. The \\nInvestment Portfolios represent the net assets managed by \\nCPP Investments for each of the base and additional CPP. We \\ndo this while balancing the exposures to risk-return factors and \\ninvesting in a more diversified set of investment strategies that \\nbetter align with CPP Investments’ comparative advantages.\\nTo diversify our portfolios, we balance the allocation to lower \\nrisk asset classes (such as public and private corporate \\nbonds, real estate, infrastructure and other real assets) with \\nthe allocation to higher-risk and higher-return strategies,  \\nsuch as:\\n• Replacing allocations to publicly traded companies with \\nallocations to privately held ones;\\n• Substituting government bonds with higher-yielding credits \\nin public and private debt;\\n• Participating in select emerging markets; and\\n• Making use of long-short investment strategies that add \\nvalue through investment selection.\\nThe use of leverage at the total portfolio level enables us to:\\n• Enhance overall diversification which also mitigates the \\nimpact of market downturns, particularly through greater \\nallocations to fixed income investments; and\\n• Increase our gross holdings of all asset classes. This \\nenables us to maximize return potential at our targeted level \\nof market risk.\\nWe regularly review our strategic mix of key risk-return \\nfactor exposures and leverage. These strategic exposures \\nare balanced to meet each Investment Portfolio’s long-term \\nobjectives at its targeted level of market risk.\\nWe translate our strategic exposures into weightings of six \\ndistinct public and private asset classes for the Investment \\nPortfolios of the base and additional CPP. These Strategic \\nPortfolios represent our strategy for making long-term asset \\nallocations. They also convey our long-term expectations for \\nallocating assets into three geographic regions – Canada, \\ndeveloped markets excluding Canada, and emerging \\nmarkets.

Within the Active Portfolio, we \\nhave developed active strategies in both private and public \\nmarkets mainly within the following investment departments: \\nCapital Markets and Factor Investing, Active Equities, Credit \\nInvestments, Private Equity, and Real Assets. \\nThe Balancing Portfolio comprises the remainder of total \\nassets that complete the portfolio. The Total Fund Management \\ndepartment manages the Balancing Portfolio and uses it as \\na completion portfolio to deliver the targeted exposures for \\nthe Investment Portfolios. The Balancing Portfolio is invested \\nprimarily in liquid, publicly traded securities. Together, the Active \\nand Balancing Portfolios deliver our targeted factor exposures \\nat the targeted market risk, while also diversifying across asset \\nclass, geography, currency and sector. \\nOur active strategies seek to identify opportunities in which internal \\nor external specialists can deliver incremental value add through \\ninvestment selection. The Chief Investment Officer (CIO) reviews \\nthe mandate and performance of each investment strategy as \\npart of the process to refresh the Fund’s capital allocations. This \\nprocess is informed by our annual investment strategy reviews, \\nwhich evaluate all strategies across several factors, including their \\ninvestment performance, value added versus benchmarks, risk \\nprofile, cost efficiency, capital deployment, and exposure delivery. \\nFindings from these reviews are one input the CIO considers when \\nupdating the targeted weight of each strategy in the context of the \\nFund. In turn, this translates into the capital budget and expected \\ngrowth trajectory of our strategies. \\nSetting the path for and measuring the effectiveness of our active management strategy: the Benchmark Portfolios\\nIn fiscal 2025, the Benchmark Portfolios replaced the Market Risk Targets (previously called the Reference Portfolios) as our \\nbenchmark against which relative performance is measured. The Benchmark Portfolios provide target allocations for our active \\nand balancing investment strategies. These also reflect the near-term planned path towards our long-term Strategic Portfolios.\\nWe construct the Benchmark Portfolios by aggregating the public market index benchmarks that serve as passive, investible \\nalternatives for each individual investment strategy. These benchmarks are described on page 21. The aggregation of the public \\nmarket indexes is updated annually based on the targeted weight of each corresponding investment strategy to the Investment \\nPortfolios. Public market indexes are also reviewed annually to ensure they continue to represent a systematic risk-equivalent \\npassive alternative for each investment strategy. The composition of the Benchmark Portfolios is provided on page 64.\\nPrior to the introduction of the Benchmark Portfolios, the Market Risk Targets served as both our performance benchmark and \\nan expression of our targeted level of market risk. This framework was introduced in fiscal 2007 when we made the strategic \\ndecision to move towards an active investment approach. Since fiscal 2016, the Fund has become more diversified and the role \\nof the Market Risk Targets shifted to primarily serve as a representation of the Fund’s targeted level of market risk. Consequently, \\nthe Market Risk Targets have become increasingly disconnected from the targeted exposures of the Investment Portfolios. \\nThe Benchmark Portfolios are a better measure of the relative performance of our Investment Portfolios because their more \\ndiversified composition reflects our efforts to enhance resiliency and achieve higher returns compared to our Market Risk \\nTargets. The Benchmark Portfolios have slightly higher long-run expected absolute returns over simple two-asset portfolios like \\nthe Market Risk Targets, associated with the benefits of diversification. The Benchmark Portfolios are also more resilient to equity \\nmarket downturns versus the Market Risk Targets. As a result, to better reflect our comprehensive investment strategies and \\nimprove performance assessment, we have transitioned to the Benchmark Portfolios as our primary performance benchmarks. \\nThe incentive compensation plan, as described on page 29, uses the Benchmark Portfolios to help assess performance. \\nOur view on foreign currency\\nA major share of our assets originates in foreign investment \\nmarkets and is denominated in non-Canadian currencies. \\nChanges in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the \\nshort-term performance of the Fund. While we could choose \\nto manage currency risk through hedging all foreign currency \\nexposures back to the Canadian dollar, we do not believe that \\nhedging the entirety of our foreign currency exposures in this \\nmanner will benefit the long-term risk-return profile of the Fund. \\nFor a Canadian global investor with an equity heavy portfolio, \\nmaintaining a well-diversified global currency composition \\nhelps to mitigate overall return volatility. Also, currency hedging \\ncarries execution costs and requires setting aside cash to meet \\ncollateral requirements under currency hedging contracts.\\nWe regularly review the Fund’s appetite for foreign currency \\nexposure as part of our portfolio design process. Our latest long-\\nterm review has concluded that our desired Canadian dollar \\nexposure can differ from the size of our Canadian investments. \\nWhen this is the case, we will hedge the Fund’s currency \\nexposures to maintain a targeted level of Canadian dollar \\nexposure. Our decisions on the target Canadian dollar \\nexposure, and the individual currency hedges needed to deliver \\nthat, are based on our ongoing assessment of what will optimize \\nthe risk-return profile of the Fund after all-in hedging costs are \\ntaken into consideration. We take into consideration changes in \\nboth the currency exposure profile of the Fund and longer-term \\nglobal economic expectations in our future hedging decisions.\\nIn the short term, the decision not to fully hedge currency \\nexposures can impact Fund returns in either direction. In \\nyears of major strengthening or weakening of the Canadian \\ndollar, the performance of the Fund may differ materially from \\nother funds that have a standing policy to hedge their foreign \\ncurrency exposures more fully. Details of the impact of foreign \\ncurrency on the Fund’s returns for fiscal 2021 to 2025 can be \\nfound on page 38.\\n 19Annual Report 2025\\nCPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 21, 'page_label': '20'}, page_content='3. Investment Selection and Tactical Positioning\\nSelecting investments – active strategies\\nInvestment selection refers to how we buy, sell, weight, and \\nmanage specific securities within a particular strategy. This \\nactivity offers a wide set of value-adding opportunities. We use \\nboth “long-only” and “long/short” strategies (see below for a \\ndescription of long/short investing).\\nSeeking to outperform a market index through investment \\nselection requires both covering costs and achieving better \\nreturns than the market index. Moreover, as markets mature, they \\nbecome more “efficient” and thus harder to outperform. Over any \\ngiven period within a particular market there will be both winning \\nand losing active managers, with wide variation between their \\nreturns. That is why successful investment selection requires us \\nto employ skilled people, internally and externally.\\nSeveral of our comparative advantages increase the long-term \\nlikelihood of investment selection success. First, our scale, \\nbrand and reputation enable us to attract and retain talent, both \\ninternal and external. Second, our long horizon provides an \\nadvantage in selecting investments. Given short-term investing \\npressures and practices found in many markets, individual \\nasset prices often diverge from their long-term intrinsic values. \\nThis divergence creates opportunities for patient investors. We \\nbelieve that our investment selection strategies can succeed in \\nmost asset classes over time.\\nWe regularly review the underlying performance of all investment \\nstrategies to evaluate whether each strategy remains:\\n1.  Likely to deliver meaningful value add incremental to a simple \\nlower-cost passive alternative; and\\n2. Worthwhile, given the additional types of risks associated \\nwith it, including the risk of underperformance relative to the \\npassive alternative.\\nIf our conclusion changes, we adjust or end the strategies \\nconcerned. \\nEach investment department is accountable for:\\n• Proposing new strategies and resizing or repositioning \\nexisting strategies, within their delegated approval authorities, \\nmandates and risk limits;\\n• Identifying, accessing and exiting from areas of investment \\nopportunity and external partnerships;\\n• Incorporating sustainability-related considerations into \\ninvestment analysis, where material. Departments work with \\nour investment partners and portfolio companies to evolve \\nour approach in these areas where applicable;\\n• Selecting individual investments to build and manage active \\nstrategies to add value, as guided by the applicable risk-return \\nexpectations over our holding period;\\n• Managing our investments to sustain and enhance \\nreturns; and\\n• Executing transactions in a timely and cost-effective way.\\nWhile seeking to deliver targeted exposures over time, our \\nactive investment departments will only make an investment \\nwhen there is a sufficient prospect of earning an appropriate \\nrisk-adjusted return. Active strategies are never used to simply \\nbridge a gap in a particular asset class, exposure, sector and/or \\ngeography. This is instead done using our Balancing Portfolio, \\nwhich is highly scalable and can be managed at lower cost. \\nInvestment success for each investment department’s active \\nstrategies is evaluated primarily based on net value added \\nrelative to pre-established benchmarks, as described further on \\nthe next page.\\nLong/short investing\\nIn public markets, many of our strategies are executed by long/short investing. A “long” investment generates a return when \\nthe underlying asset increases in value. An example is a price increase in the months following a traditional stock purchase. \\nA “short” investment is a means to generate a return when the underlying asset decreases in value. In short selling, the investor \\nsells a stock they have borrowed and buys it back later to pay off the stock loan. If the price of the asset has gone down, the \\ninvestor buys it back for less and makes a profit. Taking both types of positions across a basket of securities simultaneously \\nenables returns to be generated regardless of the direction of the overall market. The results of the long/short strategy then \\ndepend almost entirely on the selection of individual long and short positions, drawing on the skills of our internal or external \\ninvestment professionals. Long/short strategy returns are largely uncorrelated with broader market returns, allowing us to \\nimprove the diversification of our portfolios.\\nBalancing the total portfolio\\nManaging the balancing process through the Balancing Portfolio \\ninvolves maintaining each of our primary overall exposures \\nsufficiently close to their targets, as described on page 19, while \\navoiding the costs of excessive short-term trading to do so. If \\nour total portfolio exposures or total market risks have diverged \\ntoo far from their intended targets, we execute trades within the \\nBalancing Portfolio to bring our exposures and/or risk level back \\ninto line.\\nManaging the available liquidity of the Fund is an important \\nconsideration when setting targets for active strategies, which \\nare typically less liquid. We carefully manage the total size of the \\nActive Portfolio to ensure that the Fund has available liquidity \\nto meet our obligations and enough flexibility to capitalize on \\ninvestment opportunities. At the same time, we work to minimize \\ndisruptions to planned investment activities.\\n20 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 22, 'page_label': '21'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nHow we set performance benchmarks and value added measures\\nAt the investment department level, we assess performance \\nagainst public market indexes or blends of these indexes.\\nThe specific nature of the benchmarks for individual \\ninvestment departments is summarized below:\\n• Capital Markets and Factor Investing, and Active \\nEquities: Cash return benchmark on net cash deployed.\\n• Private Equity: For investments excluding Asia, a levered \\ndeveloped markets large/mid-cap public equity index. \\nFor Asia investments, weighted blend of developed and \\nemerging markets Asia-Pacific large/mid-cap public equity \\nindexes.\\n• Credit Investments: For multi-asset strategies, weighted \\nblend of global aggregate investment-grade corporate \\nbonds, global high-yield corporate bonds, U.S. levered \\nloans, and emerging market bonds.

Correspondingly, our cost profile is driven by our strategic \\nchoices on portfolio composition, including:\\n• The proportion of the Fund that is invested through our \\nbalancing strategies versus active strategies;\\n• The proportion of our active strategies that are directly \\nmanaged internally versus invested externally through fund \\nmanagers;\\n• The proportion of active strategies that are invested in public \\nversus private assets;\\n• The proportion of active strategies that are invested in \\ndeveloped versus emerging markets; and\\n• The amount of leverage we choose to deploy.\\nGiven the strategic importance of these decisions, we \\nalign our allocations of capital and resources with clear \\naccountabilities for delivering value. This allows us to objectively \\nmonitor our progress on both dollars spent and incremental \\nreturns generated.\\nOn an ongoing basis, we manage our costs in accordance with \\nour expense management policies. We also follow seniority- \\nbased management approval authorities in line with our Board- \\napproved business plan and budget.\\nAt CPP Investments, we view effective cost management as  \\na strategic imperative that can help us improve the Fund’s  \\nlong-term investment performance. We consistently and \\ncontinuously evaluate whether we are allocating our resources \\ntowards the most value-adding activities. From this we learn \\nto progressively improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our \\ncapital and resource allocations over time. It starts with  \\na strong tone from the top and is enhanced by our value-\\nconscious culture.\\nHow we allocate our resources\\nFrom a planning perspective, we balance the allocation of the \\nFund’s resources across key activities. We ensure budget is \\nallocated towards our entity-sustaining governance activities, \\nwhich includes the minimum expenses required for the Fund to \\noperate at the most basic level.\\nWe also allocate budget towards our balancing strategies.  \\nAs discussed on page 19, our balancing strategies allow us  \\nto both maintain and periodically rebalance the Investment \\nPortfolios back to their targeted sets of diversified exposures. \\nThese strategies are highly scalable and can be managed at \\nlower cost relative to our active strategies that seek to generate \\nincremental returns from investment selection. We also \\nseparately budget for our use of leverage, which allows us to \\nexpand our asset base and construct more diversified portfolios \\nat our targeted levels of market risk.\\nLastly, we manage and control the growth of our expenses by \\nallocating budgets towards our active strategies. Capital and \\nassociated budget allocations are made to active strategies \\nbased on our confidence in their ability to generate long-term \\nincremental returns. Accordingly, this also includes allocating \\nbudgets towards the more sophisticated risk management and \\noperational capabilities required to effectively govern and enable \\nour active strategies.\\nBalancing internal and external investment expertise\\nGiven our size, we can maintain dedicated right-sized \\ninternal teams to manage large parts of the Fund. In \\nmany areas, we have the in-house skills to carry out \\ninvesting activities similar to those of external firms with \\ncomparable expertise, but at lower cost.\\nHowever, we recognize there are situations in which breadth \\nof external expertise can still incrementally benefit the Fund. \\nWe use external managers for relevant and distinctive active \\nstrategies that we believe we cannot execute as effectively \\non our own. Some of our external managers also provide \\ninvestment opportunities and share valuable knowledge \\nwith us as long-term partners, which further complements \\nthe advancement of our own internal strategies. \\nNonetheless, we only use external fund managers when we \\nare sufficiently confident that they can deliver risk-adjusted \\nreturns that will more than offset the cost of their fees.\\nChoosing between internal and external management \\ninvolves a key economic trade-off for the Fund. In-house \\nmanagement incurs personnel and other expenses to \\ndevelop and implement active strategies. On the other \\nhand, using external fund managers incurs management \\nand performance fees. Using external fund managers may \\nresult in those managers, rather than the Fund, partially \\nbearing the risk of underperformance. For example, \\nwhen we use external private equity fund managers, \\nperformance fees are only paid when a manager realizes \\nprofits above a predetermined rate of return. This helps to \\nreduce the risk of incurring personnel and other expenses \\nto run internally developed active strategies and failing \\nto generate the expected value added.

The diversity of our \\npeople unlocks our ability to innovate by bringing a wide variety \\nof experiences and perspectives to the investment challenges \\nwe must solve.\\nWe believe a holistic talent strategy is essential to effectively \\nmobilize our people in delivering on our mandate and strategy. \\nThis includes fostering a strong culture of integrity, partnership and \\nhigh performance, and using our compensation framework to:\\n• Attract, motivate and retain our employees;\\n• Pay for performance; and\\n• Align the long-term interests of our employees with those \\nof the Fund.\\nWe describe each of these components in greater detail below. \\nOur culture of integrity, partnership and high performance\\nOur people are the ambassadors of our purpose-driven culture \\nand worldwide reputation, and they fuel our ability to grow \\nand adapt to an increasingly complex and fast-evolving global \\ninvestment landscape.\\nOur culture is anchored in CPP Investments’ Guiding Principles \\nof Integrity, Partnership and High Performance, as well as \\nour Code of Conduct. These principles encompass the \\norganization’s core values and provide guidance to our team in \\neveryday workplace situations.\\nCPP Investments remains focused on strengthening our culture \\nby emphasizing the importance of a shared global mindset and \\ncross-functional collaboration, so that as an integrated whole, \\nwe can deliver more value than the sum of our parts.\\nOur compensation framework \\nSuccessfully competing for talent\\nWe compete for talent with the largest investment managers \\nand financial institutions, both in Canada and globally. Offering \\nmarket competitive compensation is one of the essential \\nelements necessary to being able to attract, motivate and retain \\nthe talent we need to effectively execute CPP Investments’ \\nlegislative mandate.\\nOur incentive compensation program considers our public \\nmandate, the strategies we have chosen to pursue, and \\nthe markets in which we operate. We reward our people for \\ndelivering on quantitative and qualitative objectives that benefit \\nthe Fund. In fiscal 2024, we completed a comprehensive \\nreview of our incentive compensation program to ensure it \\naligns with our strategy. This included adopting the Benchmark \\nPortfolios to measure relative performance (see page 19). The \\nBenchmark Portfolios provide a better measure of our targeted \\nexposures through passive public market indexes. We also \\nintroduced a measure of progress towards strategic objectives \\nat the organizational level to encourage focus on organizational \\nstrategic priorities, as described on page 69.\\nFinally, we moved to expressing value added in percentage terms \\ninstead of in dollar terms to align with industry norms. The refined \\nincentive compensation plan came into effect in fiscal 2025. \\nAligning incentives to delivering on our mandate and \\nstrategic objectives\\nOur compensation program reflects our public accountability \\nand our responsibility to manage the Fund in the best interests \\nof CPP’s contributors and beneficiaries. We align incentives to \\ndelivering on our mandate and long-term strategy, while also \\nconsidering our appetite for taking on different types of risks in \\nour pursuit of value added returns.\\nWe believe that what we accomplish, and how we accomplish it, \\nare equally important. Our compensation program is grounded \\nin our Guiding Principles and is designed to meet or exceed the \\nPrinciples for Sound Compensation Practices established by the \\nFinancial Stability Board and endorsed by the G20 nations.\\nEvery employee’s total incentive is partially tied to total Fund \\nperformance. This includes achieving the Board-approved levels \\nof absolute and relative total Fund returns, as well as the Fund-\\nwide strategic objectives.

While most asset classes contributed to our overall \\npositive long-term performance, our investments in private and \\npublic equities were the primary drivers of these results.\\nPrivate equities generated a five-year net return of 15.7%, \\nand contributed to 48% of the Fund’s total returns. Public \\nequities generated returns of 11.3%, or 35% of total returns. \\nThis was consistent with the positive performance of global \\nequity markets generally over this period which benefited \\nfrom a low interest rate environment in the earlier part of the \\nfive-year period. This was followed by geopolitical events and \\nrising inflation that led to increased interest rates across many \\neconomies. This contributed to lower relative equity returns, \\nparticularly during fiscal 2023. In the latter part of the five-year \\nperiod, global equity markets achieved double-digit returns. \\nThis was mainly from the performance of U.S. equity indexes \\nthat reached all-time highs as a result of companies in the \\ninformation technology and communications services sectors \\nthat benefited from technological advancements in artificial \\nintelligence (AI).\\nOver the past five-year period, our investments in government \\nbonds produced a negative net return of 1.2%. This was mostly \\nthe result of underperformance by long-duration developed \\nmarket government bonds. ln recent years, major central \\nbanks tightened monetary policy to combat rising inflation, \\nwhich contributed to a rise in bond yields. This in turn caused \\na corresponding reduction in the market value of these bonds, \\nleading to overall losses in the five-year period.\\nThe credit asset class generated a five-year net return of 6.7%, \\nmainly driven by gains in the private credit portfolio which \\nbenefited from a recovery in demand for real estate loans and \\nconsumer credit after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as low \\ndefault rates in corporate credit investments. In recent years, \\nrising interest rates have also contributed to higher returns \\nacross our credit assets.\\nReal estate investments generated a five-year net return of \\n0.5%. The portfolio had mixed results and was particularly \\nimpacted by rising interest rates in recent years which negatively \\nimpacted the cost and availability of financing for these assets. \\nInvestments in the logistics sector were an exception, which \\nexperienced increased tenant and investor demand for most \\nof the five-year period. This contrasted with retail and office \\ninvestments, which continued to face challenges from shifting \\nconsumer behaviors towards e-commerce and evolving hybrid \\nworkplace trends.\\nInfrastructure investments generated a five-year net return of \\n8.1%. This result was influenced by investor demand over the \\nperiod for essential and long-lived assets, particularly in the \\ntransportation sector. These investments were also negatively \\nimpacted by the increase in interest rates within the five-year \\nperiod, however, to a lesser degree than other asset classes \\ndue to the inflation-hedging characteristics of the asset class.\\nFiscal 2025 performance by asset class\\nIn fiscal 2025, the Fund generated a net return of 9.3%, \\nwith positive contributions from all asset classes. The Fund \\nachieved this positive performance amid ongoing geopolitical \\nuncertainties and mixed global economic conditions. During \\nthe fiscal year, many major central banks began cutting interest \\nrates in response to slowing inflation indicators, which benefited \\nboth equity and fixed income markets. Foreign exchange \\nmovements contributed positively to net returns for all asset \\nclasses in the fiscal year, particularly from the strengthening of \\nthe U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar, as described on \\npage 38. \\nPublic equities generated a net return of 10.6% in fiscal 2025. \\nSimilar to fiscal 2024, the performance of global public equity \\nmarkets bolstered returns for most of the fiscal year, particularly \\nU.S. equities, where its growth was heavily driven by the \\ninformation technology and communication services sectors. \\nIn the last quarter of the fiscal year, global equity markets \\ndelivered mixed performance across regions due to heightened \\ngeopolitical tensions and evolving trade policies. \\nPrivate equities achieved a net return of 11.8% in fiscal 2025. \\nThe result reflected gains achieved through both direct and \\nexternally managed investments, particularly in the consumer \\ndiscretionary, healthcare and energy sectors. In the previous \\nfiscal year, returns were also driven by both direct and externally \\nmanaged investments, but predominately in the technology and \\nenergy sector.\\nInvestments in government bonds produced a net return of \\n8.1% in fiscal 2025, in contrast to the losses experienced in \\nthe previous fiscal year. This was primarily the result of foreign \\nexchange gains together with gains on certain long-duration \\ngovernment bonds, as many leading central banks reduced \\ninterest rates in response to tapering inflationary pressures \\nduring the fiscal year.\\nInvestments in the credit asset class include both private and \\npublic credit. Together, they delivered a net return of 14.4% in \\nfiscal 2025, primarily due to gains in the private credit portfolio. \\nThe gains were a result of tightening credit spreads, as leading \\ncentral banks reduced interest rates amid slowing inflation \\nindicators. Results in the previous fiscal year also benefited from \\ntightening credit spreads, as central banks paused interest rate \\nincreases amid an optimistic inflation outlook.\\nReal estate investments delivered a net return of 3.8% in fiscal \\n2025, rebounding from losses in the previous fiscal year. This \\nasset class continued to face a difficult interest rate environment \\nand challenging trends in the office and retail sectors, with \\noverall positive returns driven by foreign exchange gains.\\nInfrastructure investments delivered a net return of 9.4% in fiscal \\n2025. The portfolio had positive performance across all sectors, \\nparticularly in utilities, ports and toll roads in developed markets. \\nIn the previous fiscal year, returns were primarily driven by toll \\nroad investments, while select logistics and utilities investments \\nunderperformed.\\nThe Fund’s composition of net assets by asset class across \\ninvestment departments is presented on page 51.\\n36 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 38, 'page_label': '37'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nAnnualized Net Returns by Asset Class  Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024\\n5-Year 1-Year 5-Year 1-Year\\nPublic Equities 11.3% 10.6% 8.4% 13.8%\\nPrivate Equities 15.7% 11.8% 13.9% 10.4%\\nGovernment Bonds (1.2%) 8.1% (0.3%) (0.4%)\\nCredit 6.7% 14.4% 3.8% 10.8%\\nReal Estate 0.5% 3.8% 0.7% (5.0%)\\nInfrastructure 8.1% 9.4% 5.9% 2.6%\\nTotal Fund1 9.0% 9.3% 7.7% 8.0%\\n1.

We believe long-term results are a more \\nappropriate measure of CPP Investments’ performance than \\nquarterly or annual returns. In addition to measuring our \\nabsolute returns over long horizons, we assess the effectiveness \\nof the strategic choices we make through measures of relative \\nperformance. The Fund’s incremental returns are measured \\nin annualized percentage value added terms.

The figure is calculated on \\na nominal basis, net of all expenses.\\nThe Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is accountable for designing \\nthe base CPP and additional CPP Strategic and Investment \\nPortfolios in a way that seeks to maximize Fund returns \\nwithout undue risk of loss. This includes determining exposure \\ntargets and how we pursue diversification supported by \\nleverage across our active and balancing strategies within our \\ninvestment departments.\\nIn order to maximize returns for the Fund, all key sources of \\nreturns are managed on an integrated basis. In particular, asset \\nclass diversification is a prerequisite to generate value added \\nfrom private asset allocations and from investment selection \\nwithin strategies. In addition, maximizing total returns for the \\nFund is done in part by determining the nearer-term and longer-\\nterm capital allocations to our active and balancing investment \\nstrategies as well as the corresponding funding to be raised \\nthrough our financing strategies.

Therefore, a key \\nstrategic decision is to set a higher target level of market risk \\nfor the Investment Portfolios.

These allocations had a \\nnegative impact, as developed market public equities – heavily \\nweighted towards the U.S. (over 60%) – outperformed many \\nother asset classes over the period.\\n• Compositional differences within the equity sectors and \\ngeographies in which we invest relative to those in the \\nbroad public equity market indexes had a negative impact. \\nIn particular, the Fund maintained a lower relative weight \\nin the U.S. public equity market, where returns benefited \\nfrom the outsized performance of a small number of very \\nlarge companies in the U.S. information technology and \\ncommunication services sectors. Other smaller negative \\ncontributors were higher weights in emerging markets and \\nreal estate, and recent elevated borrowing costs for leverage.\\nSetting the risk target\\nAt least once every three years, we review the risk appetite \\nfor both the base and additional CPP.

This is further described on \\np ag e 17.\\nIn fiscal 2007, the Market Risk Target for the base CPP was \\nintroduced at a targeted risk level of 65% equity and 35% \\ndebt. This level is in the typical range for conventional fully \\nfunded pension plans. \\nIn fiscal 2015, our Board approved an increase of the base \\nCPP’s targeted level of market risk from 65% equity and \\n35% debt to its current 85% equity and 15% debt, phased in \\nbeginning from the fiscal year 2016 through to 2018. For the \\nadditional CPP, the risk target was established on January 1, \\n2019 at 50% equity and 50% debt; this was increased to \\n55% equity and 45% debt starting in fiscal 2022. As a result \\nof these decisions, the increases in risk combined with the \\nhigher returns of equities compared to debt have generated \\nannualized incremental returns for the Fund of positive \\n1.7% over the past 10-year period from the beginning of \\nfiscal 2016 to the end of fiscal 2025. Over this same period, \\nour combined decisions on targeted risk and exposures \\ngenerated an annualized incremental return of 0.8%.\\nInvestment Selection – Generating above-market returns \\nover the long term\\nDiversification across asset classes also enables two further \\nmajor decisions to:\\n1. Invest a significant proportion of the portfolio in private \\ninvestments, which are particularly suited to the deployment of \\nour comparative advantages as described on page 12; and\\n2. Maximize the use of our active strategies, seeking to \\ngenerate value added through investment selection – the \\ncombination of the choices of individual securities, and the \\nsector and geographical composition within each strategy.\\nTo enable an objective assessment of the contributions of each \\nactive strategy to total Fund performance, the value gained or \\nlost through investment selection, after all related expenses, is \\nmeasured against the Benchmark Portfolios and its underlying \\ncomponent indexes.\\nOver the past five years, investment selection yielded an \\nannualized value added of negative 0.7%, net of expenses. This \\nresult was heavily impacted by market volatility experienced \\nin fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In that \\nyear, the Fund returned 20.4%, however, it underperformed the \\nBenchmark Portfolios which returned 31.6%. In fiscal 2025, net \\nvalue added against the Benchmark Portfolios was negative \\n1.6%, and also contributed to the current negative five-year \\nresult. The Benchmark Portfolios’ outperformance in fiscal 2025 \\nwas mainly attributable to levered global public equity indexes \\nwithin the portfolios, which achieved double-digit returns. \\nOver the past two years, the Fund’s returns have trailed the \\nBenchmark Portfolios, in part due to the Benchmark Portfolios’ \\ngreater concentration in U.S. public equities, where a small \\nnumber of large companies in the information technology and \\ncommunication services sectors significantly outperformed the \\nbroader market. \\nThe contributions by investment department to five-year value \\nadded were mixed, with the overall negative results mostly \\nattributable to the Private Equity department.

At the end of the \\nprior fiscal year, this annualized five-year net value added was \\npositive 2.0%. Single-year results can vary widely and can have \\nan impact on longer term results. The current five-year negative \\nvalue added was largely due to the Fund underperforming the \\nBenchmark Portfolios in fiscal 2021 which is no longer being \\noffset by the Fund’s outperformance in fiscal 2020.

These actions may also, over time, result in \\nsignificant shifts in the structure and nature of international \\ntrade and the role of the U.S. in the global economy and \\ncapital markets; \\n• In fiscal 2025 the environment shifted from generally lower \\ngrowth, higher interest rates and higher inflation, to more \\nregional and country-specific divergence. This divergence \\nmay be further amplified by fragmented trade and tariff \\narrangements across countries and regions in the future;\\n• Conflicts with broader geopolitical implications, such \\nas those in Ukraine and the Middle East, also continue \\nto create market uncertainty and challenges for \\ninvestors; and\\n• Debates may continue in the Province of Alberta regarding \\nthe possibility of exiting the CPP and creating a provincial \\npension plan.\\nThese and other factors present a complex environment \\nto navigate as we seek to generate returns. We continue \\nto manage, monitor and evaluate geopolitical and \\nmacroeconomic developments and the potential impacts \\nthat different scenarios could have on the Fund and our \\ninvestment returns. This includes incorporating these factors \\ninto portfolio construction and asset allocation, evaluating \\nour exposure to emerging markets, conducting scenario \\nand policy analyses and stress testing, augmenting crisis \\nresponse planning, leveraging our global workforce with local \\nsubject matter expertise and reviewing our risk management \\nplans to ensure we remain within our risk appetite if adverse \\nscenarios materialize.\\n• Sustainability-related factors continued to evolve during \\nfiscal 2025. While the whole economy transition showed signs \\nof stagnation, physical risk events continued to materialize. \\nAs well, fiscal 2025 saw a change in the political discourse \\nrelated to sustainability, in particular in the U.S., which in \\nturn saw important climate-related policy changes. We \\nconsider and integrate sustainability-related factors into \\nour risk management processes as well as the portfolio \\nand investment life cycles, where material. Our internal \\ngovernance approach guides how we assess these risks \\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively, including the risks \\nassociated with delivering on our approach to climate change \\nand a range of tools and analytics used to measure and \\nmonitor sustainability-related factors. Refer to pages 66-68 \\nfor additional details on how we translate our climate beliefs \\ninto action.\\n• Talent management and the challenges associated with \\nattracting and retaining employees remained a risk in fiscal \\n2025. As an employer of global talent, we face a competitive \\nlabour market for diverse skill sets requiring continuous \\nupskilling and strategic resource allocation. We proactively \\nmanage this by emphasizing talent attraction, development, \\nand retention. It will remain a priority to build the capabilities \\nof the organization. This includes enhancing strategic talent \\nplanning to align capabilities with organizational goals, \\ninvesting in career development programs and evolving \\nour internal career framework as well as reviewing our \\ncompensation against the market for high-demand skills \\nto stay competitive. Refer to page 29 for details on our \\ncompensation framework.\\n• Disruptive technology remained a risk and a driver of \\nopportunities this fiscal year as commercial use cases for AI \\ncontinued to grow rapidly. As our AI strategy evolves, so do \\nthe associated risks including data protection, confidentiality, \\nintellectual property infringement, and inaccurate output. The \\ninability to effectively manage these risks or adopt innovative \\ntechnologies could negatively impact our investments and \\noperations. We are enhancing our internal AI governance \\nas adoption expands, updating guidance on responsible AI \\nusage and to help mitigate emerging AI risk exposure.\\n• Cyber security breaches remained a risk given such breaches \\ncould result in investigation and containment costs, loss \\nof sensitive data, regulatory fines, and negative reputation \\nimpact. External threats have risen, including state-sponsored \\nattacks from increasing geopolitical tensions, phishing \\nattacks, malware, leakage of confidential data and cyber \\nfraud. New and evolving technologies make it easier to \\nlaunch attacks, but also enhance our capabilities to prevent, \\ndetect and respond to incidents. As part of our efforts to \\ncontinually improve information technology controls and \\nensure our employees remain vigilant, we conduct cyber \\ntable-top exercises with senior management, utilize advanced \\ntechnologies to protect our infrastructure, hold an annual \\n“Information Security Month” to raise awareness of potential \\nthreats and periodically engage third parties to assess the \\nmaturity of our information security capabilities. In fiscal 2025, \\nthere have been no incidents that had a significant impact on \\nCPP Investments.\\n42 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 44, 'page_label': '43'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\n• Relative underperformance remains a risk as our returns \\nrelative to passive alternative indexes, represented by our \\nBenchmark Portfolios, were negative this fiscal year. However, \\nour 10-year relative returns remain positive. Our relative \\nreturns can vary significantly year over year. This year, our \\nrelative returns were negatively impacted as levered global \\npublic equity indexes within the Benchmark Portfolios \\nachieved double-digit returns. Underperformance relative \\nto passive indexes may cause stakeholders to question the \\nmerits of our active management strategy or our ability to \\ndeliver on our mandate. We monitor and assess the drivers \\nof absolute and relative performance through an attribution \\nframework and perform risk-adjusted performance analysis. \\nOur key sources of returns are discussed on page 14. They \\nallow us to measure the impact of each part of our investment \\nframework. This helps us to better understand the drivers of \\nFund performance over short- and longer-term horizons and \\nevaluate our strategic choices. For further discussion of our \\nresults, see page 34.\\nManagement of key risks\\nWe believe effective risk management adds to our comparative \\nadvantages and allows us to both generate and safeguard \\nvalue. We regularly facilitate independent external reviews of our \\nrisk management practices and continually make improvements. \\nThese include an annual review of risk appetite as well as \\nongoing improvements to our key investment risk measures and \\nlimits. In the sections that follow, we outline how we define and \\nmeasure our key risks. We also discuss notable trends and our \\napproach to managing these risks within our risk appetite.\\nPlan adjustment risk\\nPlan adjustment risk is the risk of adverse contribution or \\nbenefits adjustments to the base CPP and additional CPP \\narising from adverse investment experience. It is an overarching \\nconcept we consider when determining our risk appetite and it \\ncan be impacted by any of the key risks we face as a Fund. It is \\nan input into how we design our portfolio, target market risk and \\ngovern risk.\\nAdverse adjustments to CPP benefits and contributions can \\nbe impacted by a confluence of factors, including the actual \\nand expected returns of the Fund as well as many other factors \\nsuch as real earnings growth, mortality rates and population \\ngrowth. These broader Canadian demographic and economic \\nfactors are beyond our control. However, we regularly measure \\nand monitor plan adjustment risk to seek to ensure we do our \\npart through our investment performance to support the long-\\nterm financial sustainability of the CPP. Internally, we manage \\nplan adjustment risk by first determining the appropriate level \\nof market risk to target for the base CPP and additional CPP, \\nand then seeking to maximize returns at their targeted levels \\nof market risk.\\nWe expect plan adjustment risk to be incrementally lowered \\nthrough active management. This reduces the likelihood that \\nfuture contributions or benefits may need to be adversely \\nadjusted as a result of insufficient Fund returns, holding other \\nactuarial assumptions constant. However, even in periods where \\nthe Fund outperforms the real returns actuarially assumed in \\nassessing financial sustainability of the CPP, future contribution \\nrates may have to be adjusted if the impact of non-investment \\nfactors (such as demographic trends) is sufficiently large.\\nMarket risk\\nDetermining our market risk appetite is the single most \\nimportant decision in building our long-term Investment \\nPortfolios, as discussed on page 17. We define market risk as \\nthe risk of investment loss arising from fluctuations in market \\nprices and rates, which includes equity prices, interest rates, \\ncredit spreads and currency exchange rates. We express \\nour targeted level of market risk in equity-debt risk (EDR) \\nequivalency terms using the base CPP and additional CPP \\nMarket Risk Targets (previously called the Reference Portfolios). \\nWe deliberately rebalance the Fund when it drifts too far from \\nour targeted levels of market risk.\\nGiven the multi-faceted nature of the market risks we face, we \\nmeasure, monitor and manage our risk profile using a number \\nof different complementary risk measures. This includes our \\none-year potential loss measure which captures potential loss \\nresulting from fluctuations in market prices and rates. In fiscal \\n2025, we updated our methodology for measuring one-year \\npotential loss to exclude credit risk factors. We measure credit \\nrisk through different measures including credit value-at-risk. \\nSee page 44 for details on credit risk.\\nWe measure the potential loss in our Investment Portfolios \\nagainst our appetite over both short- and longer-term time \\nhorizons. Given our targeted level of market risk, our one-year \\npotential loss measures are all estimates of losses that we do \\nnot expect to exceed 19 times out of 20. The graph on the next \\npage outlines the one-year potential loss for the base CPP and \\nadditional CPP Investment Portfolios over the last five years. \\nAs at March 31, 2025, our one-year potential loss for the base \\nCPP Investment Portfolio was estimated to be $112 billion or \\n17%. As at end of fiscal 2024, it was estimated to be $96 billion \\nor 16%. Our one-year potential loss for the additional CPP \\nInvestment Portfolio was estimated to be $7 billion or 12%, \\ncompared to at the end of fiscal 2024 when it was estimated \\nto be $4 billion or 11%. The year-over-year increases in one-\\nyear potential loss are predominantly due to an increase in \\noverall market volatility, higher public equity exposure, driven by \\nmarket gains and equity purchases from rebalancing activities \\nand higher Fund leverage; this was partially offset by higher \\nDeveloped Market Fixed Income exposure which reduces \\nFund volatility.\\nEach asset class’ risk of potential loss on a standalone basis \\nfor the total Fund is shown in the table on the next page. \\nStandalone risk of potential loss measures the risk of an asset \\nclass without considering the manner in which it interacts with \\nthe rest of the portfolio. On this basis, the largest contributors \\nto the Fund’s one-year potential loss are public and private \\nequities. However, the overall estimated potential loss for the \\nFund is reduced after we incorporate the estimated benefits of \\ndiversification through consideration of correlations across asset \\nclasses within the portfolio.\\n 43Annual Report 2025\\nCPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 45, 'page_label': '44'}, page_content='0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\n20252024202320222021\\nbase CPP additional CPP\\nOne-Year Potential Loss1  \\n($ billions) \\nAsset Class\\nOne-Year \\nPotential Loss\\nPublic Equity 37\\nPrivate Equity 48\\nPublic Fixed Income 33\\nCredit 8\\nReal Assets 25\\nCash and Absolute Return Strategies 28\\nDiversification (62)\\nTotal 117\\nFiscal 2025 Total One-Year Potential Loss  \\nby Asset Class  \\n($ billions) \\n1. Data from all fiscal years has been re-stated for the updated methodology as described on page 43.\\nWe seek to mitigate the risk of market losses by investing across \\na wide spectrum of asset classes and investment strategies. As \\npart of our risk management practices, we perform historical \\nstress tests and scenario analysis to assess the impact of \\npotential events. We also identify possible portfolio vulnerabilities \\nthat may not be fully captured by standard risk measures and \\nmodels. These include how severe market and geopolitical \\nevents could affect the Investment Portfolios. Stress scenarios \\nare hypothetical events that are highly dependent on our \\nassumptions. These assumptions will vary based on different \\nfactors such as macro-economic variables, market conditions or \\ngeopolitical events. We run various scenario analyses to assess \\nour ability to manage potential risks and seek to ensure potential \\nlosses are broadly consistent with risk appetite.\\nBelow are examples of scenarios that we run and monitor on a \\nregular basis:\\n• A repeat of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 – In this \\nscenario, we apply changes observed in relevant market \\nparameters during the period from April 2008 to March 2009, as \\nan instantaneous shock to the portfolio. This includes the foreign \\ncurrency gains typically realized in market stresses, where the \\nCanadian dollar depreciates against the U.S. dollar. We estimate \\nthat if an event like the GFC were to recur, it would result in \\nlosses of approximately 11% or $77 billion as of March 31, 2025. \\n• Inflation and interest rates – In this scenario, we apply changes \\nobserved during the 2022 interest rate hike cycle. During that \\ntime, bonds and equities sold off in tandem as central banks \\nrapidly raised interest rates to seek to bring inflation under \\ncontrol. We estimate that if an event like the 2022 rate hike \\ncycle were to recur, it would result in losses of approximately \\n8% or $59 billion as of March 31, 2025. \\nWe perform ad hoc analysis on various plausible stress scenarios, \\nincluding based on current global events, such as inflation shocks, \\npotential impacts of economic and regulatory policies, the U.S. \\nadministration’s policy actions, China-U.S. geopolitical tensions, \\nand bank credit crisis scenarios. We also perform sensitivity \\nanalysis on specific components of market risk, including equity, \\ninterest rate, credit spread, and currency risks. See Note 8 to the \\nFinancial Statements on page 128 for details.\\nCredit risk\\nWe define credit risk as the risk of potential loss of investment \\nvalue due to direct or indirect counterparty exposure to a \\ndefaulted entity and/or financial losses due to deterioration of an \\nentity’s credit quality. As we seek additional sources of return \\nthrough active management, our credit risk increases.\\nWe manage our credit risk through a variety of means including \\ndealing only with authorized counterparties that meet the \\nminimum credit rating and limiting maximum exposures to any \\nindividual counterparty. We also assess credit risk through \\ndifferent measures, including credit value-at-risk which \\nmeasures losses across all debt investments resulting from \\nrating migration and default that we would not expect to exceed \\n19 times out of 20. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements on \\npage 130 for additional details on counterparty exposures and \\npotential losses due to defaults and credit rating deterioration.\\nLiquidity and leverage risk\\nOur liquidity and leverage risk increases as we pursue active \\ninvestment selection and use leverage to diversify the Fund. We \\ndefine liquidity risk as the risk of incurring unacceptable losses \\nwhile obtaining the funds needed to:\\n• Meet payment obligations as they become due;\\n• Fund new investments; or\\n• Rebalance our portfolio in periods of stress.\\nLeverage risk is a related concept, which we define as the risk \\nof excessive financial obligations that could heighten market and \\nliquidity risks during periods of stress.\\nWe manage short-term liquidity risk through the liquidity \\ncoverage ratio (LCR). In fiscal 2025, the Board approved \\nchanging the time horizon for the liquidity coverage ratio limit \\nfrom 10 days to one month. The one-month liquidity coverage \\nratio measures the amount of available cash and liquid assets \\nrelative to our CPP and investment obligations over any one-\\nmonth period calibrated to include cash outflows in periods of \\nmarket stress. As at March 31, 2025, the one-month liquidity \\ncoverage ratio was 6.9 and remains well above the minimum \\nliquidity requirement of 1.0.

The higher we set \\nour risk target, the higher the long-term expected returns, \\nbut also the greater the shorter-term volatility and potential \\nfor reported losses. For additional details on how we manage \\nand mitigate potential financial impacts, refer to our Total \\nPortfolio Investment Framework. The framework describes \\nhow we seek to deliver on our mandate for current and future \\ngenerations. See page 16.\\n• Reputation impacts refer to the loss of CPP Investments’ \\ncredibility and brand value due to internal or external factors. \\nThese impacts are often related to and/or are a consequence \\nof the other key risks. Harm to our reputation might result in \\nweakened public trust or support from the CPP’s federal and \\nprovincial government stewards, more intrusive oversight, \\npolitical risk, diminished investment opportunities or reduced \\naccess to talent. Any harm to our reputation could also have \\nfinancial impacts. The responsibility to protect our reputation \\nextends to every employee, our entire Management team and \\nthe Board of Directors. It is embedded in our organizational \\nculture. Our reputation management strategy involves an \\nintegrated approach to anticipating and managing issues. \\nWe continue to build our reputation and brand proactively \\nwith key stakeholders globally to support our business \\nobjectives and mitigate risk. The Senior Managing Director \\n& Global Head of Public Affairs and Communications holds \\ndelegated accountability from the CEO for the Fund’s \\nreputation management strategy and for the implementation \\nof our reputation management programs. We maintain formal \\nprocesses to understand and assess potential reputation \\nimpacts associated with our investments. We also monitor \\nmacro reputation issues, including the top and emerging risks \\nmentioned on page 42 that affect the organization as a whole. \\nWe escalate to the Board of Directors emerging risks and \\nissues with the potential to materially impact our reputation \\nas they arise.\\n46 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 48, 'page_label': '47'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nManaging Costs as We Pursue Value\\nIn accordance with our mandate, we seek to maximize returns without undue risk of loss.

These expenses are driven by our \\ndecisions on how to develop and maintain a professional \\ninvestment management organization. Operating expenses \\nwere $1,756 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $1,617 million in \\nfiscal 2024 driven by increases in both personnel and general \\nadministrative expenses. Operating expenses as a percentage \\nof net assets declined to 26.1 basis points in fiscal 2025, \\ndown from 27.5 basis points in fiscal 2024. The five-year rolling \\naverage of 27.7 marks the lowest level in the past five years. This \\ncontinued decline since fiscal 2020 reflects improved economies \\nof scale, driven by asset growth and enhanced productivity.\\nPersonnel expenses were $1,166 million in fiscal 2025 compared \\nto $1,087 million in fiscal 2024.

Excluding the \\nimpact of foreign exchange, personnel expenses increased by \\n5% over the prior year.\\nOur personnel expenses are directly driven by the types of \\nactive strategies we choose to pursue. This requires us to hire \\npeople with the requisite skill sets to enable and conduct these \\nactivities. We design our total compensation packages so that a \\nsignificant portion is variable.

North America was the \\nprimary contributor, while Europe ended the year flat. In North \\nAmerica, gains were diversified across media, communications, \\ntechnology and financials investments. Emerging markets \\nremained challenging this year, with losses in Brazil detracting \\nfrom overall results. Fiscal 2025 was a difficult year for active \\ninvesting in Brazil, given its high interest rates, increasing \\ninflation expectations and a depreciating currency. Asia \\ncontributed a small gain this year.\\nThis fiscal year’s gain was lower than fiscal 2024, a year in which \\ndeveloped markets programs earned their highest annual return \\nsince inception.

AE employs an absolute return strategy which \\nhedges factor exposures and systematic market risk factors \\nsuch as country and sector risk. However, idiosyncratic risk \\nis heightened as single name concentration is a fundamental \\ncomponent of AE’s mandate and this risk is measured and \\nmonitored on an ongoing basis.

As part of our investment strategy \\nand portfolio design, we use scenario analysis to support \\ndiversification across climate risks and opportunities. Our \\nscenarios are sourced from reputable organizations such as \\nthe Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \\nTo complement total carbon emissions and carbon footprint \\nmetrics in our climate risk monitoring, we use scenario analysis \\nto assess the potential financial impacts of climate-related \\nrisks. Scenario analysis is not a forecast but rather a tool that \\nexplores a range of plausible future pathways aligned with \\nspecific climate temperature scenarios. These pathways are \\nbased on assumptions about government policies, energy \\nsupply and demand, technological advancements, and other \\nkey factors. Given the limitations of existing data, models, and \\nscenario analysis methodologies, we employ multiple climate \\nrisk scenario analysis tools to enhance our ability to assess and \\nunderstand these risks. \\nOne of the metrics we use is Climate Value at Risk (Climate \\nVaR), developed by MSCI. This metric is commonly used \\nwithin the financial sector. It estimates the potential financial \\nimpact of climate-related risks on companies by modeling \\nfuture costs and revenues driven by policy risks, technological \\nopportunities, and physical risks and opportunities. Future costs \\nand revenues are projected to 2050 for transition risk scenarios \\nand to 2100 for physical risk scenarios, then discounted to \\npresent values and expressed as a percentage change from an \\nasset’s current market value. For this analysis, we rely on widely \\nrecognized climate scenarios recommended by the NGFS and \\naggregate the company-level Climate VaR estimates to arrive \\nat estimated valuation impacts at the portfolio level. Portfolio-\\nlevel results include Climate VaR for corporate securities only; \\nsovereign bonds are excluded as their methodology is less \\nwell-developed.\\nBased on NGFS scenarios, MSCI Climate VaR estimates \\nindicate a potential negative impact of up to 8% on the Fund’s \\nmarket value under the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario, which \\nrepresents a high transition risk scenario. This scenario \\nassumes that global warming is limited to 1.5°C through \\nstringent climate policies and technological innovation, \\nachieving net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. Conversely, under \\nthe most punitive NGFS scenario for physical risk – a “hot house \\nworld” in which only currently implemented policies remain in \\nplace, leading to significantly higher global temperatures – MSCI \\nClimate VaR estimates suggest a potential negative impact of \\nup to 4% on the Fund’s market value. These scenario analysis \\nresults relating to transition and physical risk are not directly \\ncomparable to each other, in light of the different nature and \\nmagnitude of the risks being assessed, and timeframes over \\nwhich the scenarios address these risks. \\nWhile the MSCI Climate VaR approach provides valuable \\nportfolio-level insights and is regularly employed by financial \\ninstitutions, it remains subject to the significant broader \\nmarket-based limitations inherent in current climate scenario \\nanalysis methodologies. The MSCI Climate VaR methodology \\nis expected to evolve regularly as it integrates a broad range of \\nvariables and assumptions. As a result, potential impacts may \\nbe underestimated due to methodological and data limitations \\nand could fluctuate over time, largely driven by scenario updates \\nand modeling refinements rather than changes in portfolio \\ncomposition. Although the results are not directly comparable, \\nto enhance the robustness of our ability to understand and \\nassess climate-related risks, we also conduct scenario analysis \\nbased on guidelines published by central banks, as well as other \\nmethodologies, all of which also remain subject to significant \\nlimitations including incomplete data, limited scope, outdated \\nscenarios and other constraints. We will continue to apply \\nappropriate diligence in assessing quantification results and \\nactively monitor the availability of alternative methods and tools.\\nAt the individual asset level, where climate change impacts are \\ndeemed to be material to investment and asset management \\nactivities, we consider the potential financial impacts of high-\\nphysical risk scenarios or high-transition risk scenarios, or both, \\nas relevant. To support analysis, we apply scenarios from a \\nnumber of established sources, including the IPCC.\\n68 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 70, 'page_label': '69'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nImplementing Our Strategic Objectives\\nIn fiscal 2025, our enterprise priorities were knowledge sharing, relative value capabilities, and productivity.

Valuation techniques include earnings multiples, \\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, pricing models and other \\nindustry-accepted valuation methods.\\nSince estimating the fair value of private investments requires \\nthe application of judgment alongside data, we employ several \\nlayers of checks and controls:\\n• The Finance department is responsible for the oversight \\nof valuation processes, controls and results, independent \\nfrom investment departments. The department comprises \\naccredited professionals with extensive experience valuing \\nprivate assets at accounting and valuations firms, asset \\nmanagers and other large pension funds.\\n• We use third-party appraisers and external valuation experts \\nin a risk-based manner to provide independent views on \\nfair values. These experts have knowledge and familiarity \\nwith local market conditions, market transactions and \\nindustry trends.\\n• In instances where fair values are obtained directly from  \\nexternal investment managers, we regularly review the quality \\nof our partners’ valuation practices.\\nBoth Management (through the Valuation Committee) and \\nthe Board of Directors (through the Audit Committee) provide \\ngovernance over valuation processes and controls.\\nWe continuously review valuation practices to ensure that \\nwe maintain high-quality risk management and governance \\nstandards that are required to uphold and sustain the \\nconfidence and trust of our stakeholders.\\nKey performance and non-IFRS measures\\nThe disclosure of certain non-IFRS Accounting Standards \\n(non-IFRS) measures, presented on the next page, is intended \\nto provide readers with supplemental information that reflects \\nManagement’s perspective on the Fund’s performance.

For the five-year period \\nended March 31, 2025, the Fund generated an annualized net \\nreturn of 9.0%. Net value added relative to the Benchmark \\nPortfolios over this period was negative 0.7% annualized. This \\nnegative result mostly reflected the Benchmark Portfolios’ \\noutperformance in fiscal 2021 as public markets rallied following \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic market downturn in fiscal 2020, \\nand more recently, from outsized performance of U.S. public \\nequities which were particularly driven by a concentrated set of \\ntechnology companies. For more on our financial results, see \\nthe Management’s Discussion and Analysis section. For more \\nabout the composition of the Benchmark Portfolios refer to \\npage 64. \\nCompensation outcomes\\nOur focus on investment performance is foundational to our \\ncompensation program which was revised this year to also \\ninclude achievement against strategic objectives (as described \\non page 69). This design supports a strong alignment between \\nCPP Investments’ employees and our singular purpose: to \\nmaximize returns without undue risk of loss for the 22 million \\ncontributors and beneficiaries of the Canada Pension Plan.\\nThe HRCC retains full discretion to reward performance for the \\nSenior Management Team within a range of zero to two times \\nthe target incentive levels. It may also award salary adjustments \\nor other compensation arrangements. This allows the HRCC \\nto evaluate performance comprehensively and reward not only \\nresults, but also the manner in which they were achieved.\\nOur deliberate focus is on our long-term investment \\nperformance, including strong absolute performance as well as \\nvalue added above the relative performance benchmark. This \\nensures we reward overall achievement, not just short-term \\ngains. Our compensation program continues to measure both \\nquantitative and qualitative outcomes, including how our CEO, \\nSenior Management Team and employees deliver on long-term \\nstrategic business objectives.\\nOver the past five years, CPP Investments’ total Fund net return \\nexceeded targets, while value added was below the Benchmark \\nPortfolios’ return. The HRCC also assessed performance to be \\nvery strong against organizational strategic objectives agreed \\nupon at the beginning of the year. Combined, these measures \\nresulted in a Fund multiplier of 1.04.\\nDecisions on CEO pay\\nOur assessment of Mr. Graham for the year reflects recognition \\nof his achievements. The Board awarded him an incentive \\nmultiplier of 1.60. The weighted average of the Fund multiplier \\nand the department/individual multiplier resulted in an overall \\nincentive multiplier for Mr. Graham of 1.32.\\nThe Board awarded Mr. Graham total direct compensation of \\n$6,296,596 for fiscal 2025, consisting of salary, an in-year award \\nand deferred awards, as shown in Table 2. Mr. Graham also \\nreceived standard pension and benefits.\\nFurther details on compensation of the CEO and other Named \\nExecutive Officers are included in the Compensation Discussion \\nand Analysis that follows.\\nBarry Perry \\nChair, Human Resources and Compensation Committee \\n76 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 78, 'page_label': '77'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nThe role and activities of the HRCC of the Board of Directors\\nAs discussed in the Governance section, the Human Resources \\nand Compensation Committee (HRCC) advises the Board of \\nDirectors on human resources matters.

This is \\nespecially true after taking into account how the design and \\nmanagement of our Investment Portfolios played a role in \\ndelivering positive performance relative to our five-year total \\nFund Absolute Performance goal. The multiplier outcome of 1.04 \\nwas also in consideration of our five-year absolute and relative \\nperformance and achievements against strategic objectives. \\nWe are confident that our decisions regarding department \\nand individual compensation reflect our assessment of the \\nSenior Management Team’s performance, relative to their pre-\\nestablished objectives for the year. They are also appropriately \\naligned with the interests of CPP contributors and beneficiaries.\\nPlease refer to the Strategy section on page 29 for more \\ninformation on our compensation philosophy. Our website has \\nadditional details on the mandates of the HRCC and Board of \\nDirectors. The composition of the current HRCC is on pages 93 \\nand 94.\\nThe HRCC uses the services of Hugessen Consulting Inc. \\nto provide independent advice, information and guidance on \\nexecutive compensation issues. Hugessen cannot provide any \\nservices to Management without prior approval from the HRCC. \\nHugessen received $152,355 for its services to the HRCC in \\nfiscal 2025 ($184,749 in fiscal 2024).\\nFiscal 2025 compensation disclosures\\nBelow, and earlier in the Strategy section, we outline the \\nperformance measures used to make compensation decisions \\nfor all employees. This includes our CEO and Named Executive \\nOfficers (NEOs). We also outline the compensation outcomes \\nfor fiscal 2025. We disclose compensation information for key \\nmanagement personnel as a group. We also disclose individual \\ncompensation figures for the CEO, the CFO, and the next four \\nhighest-paid Senior Managing Directors (SMDs). Our NEOs this \\nyear include:\\n• President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO) – John Graham\\n• SMD & Chief Financial Officer (CFO) – Kristina Fanjoy\\n• SMD, Global Head of Real Assets & Head of Europe – \\nMaximilian Biagosch\\n• SMD & Chief Investment Officer – Edwin Cass\\n• SMD, Head of Asia Pacific & Active Equities Asia –  \\nAgus Tandiono\\n• SMD & Global Head of Credit Investments – Andrew Edgell \\nPerformance measures\\nManagement outlines financial and qualitative objectives in our \\nbusiness plan each fiscal year. The Board of Directors approves \\nthese objectives and reviews progress against organizational \\nobjectives quarterly and at year-end. This ensures a pay-for-\\nperformance approach to evaluation and compensation.\\nTotal Fund performance\\nWe determine total Fund performance measuring absolute and \\nrelative performance over a five-year period, equally weighted at \\n40%, and performance against our annual strategic objectives \\nweighted at 20%. For fiscal 2025:\\n• For the absolute performance component, the Fund must \\nachieve a five-year annualized target return of 6.24% which will \\nresult in a target multiplier of 1x.\\n• For the relative performance component, the Fund must reach \\na five-year percentage value added (PVA) target of 0.39% \\nrelative to the benchmark to achieve a relative performance \\nmultiplier of 1x.\\n• The Board retains discretion to assess performance against \\nstrategic objectives agreed upon at the beginning of the year, \\nand can award a multiplier outcome between 0x-2x for this \\ncomponent.\\nThe Board reviews targets annually.

This \\nincludes the companies in which we invest, and it extends \\nto CPP Investments as well. Strong governance practices \\nhelp to ensure compliance with the law and with the ethical \\nstandards that we expect of everyone at CPP Investments. We \\nare committed to rigorous standards of corporate governance \\nand strive to be a leader in global governance best practices for \\nour industry.\\nGood governance starts with our Board of Directors. The \\nGovernance Committee of the Board regularly assesses \\nour corporate governance and works to ensure the Board’s \\neffectiveness. In doing so, it considers evolving global best \\npractices, regulatory changes and stakeholder expectations. \\nThe Committee works to ensure the Board’s effectiveness by \\nreviewing criteria and qualifications for Directors, planning for \\nBoard succession and overseeing Director orientation and \\nongoing development programs. The Committee also oversees \\nthe annual Board evaluation process. We monitor the application \\nof the Code of Conduct and related policies in fostering a \\nculture of ethics and integrity throughout CPP Investments. In \\naddition, we recommend for Board approval the Proxy Voting \\nPrinciples and Guidelines, which provide guidance to the public \\ncompanies in which CPP Investments owns shares on how we \\nare likely to vote on matters put to shareholders.\\nFiscal 2025 activities\\nOne of the primary responsibilities of the Governance \\nCommittee is to lead the Board in assessing and planning for \\nBoard composition and succession, ensuring an appropriate \\nbalance of renewal and continuity. This year, our Board \\nrenewal work included in-depth searches for candidates to \\nsucceed Tahira Hassan, who has served on CPP Investments’ \\nBoard for three full terms, and Nadir Mohamed, who retired \\nfrom CPP Investments Board in December 2024. Following \\na comprehensive search process, the Board made a \\nrecommendation to CPP Investments’ stewards for a candidate \\nto succeed Ms. Hassan, and that recommendation remains \\nunder review. The search for a successor to Mr. Mohamed is in \\nprogress. The Board also recommended the re-appointments \\nof Barry Perry and Sylvia Chrominska for their second and third \\nterms, respectively, and we continued to advance our earlier \\nrecommendation, made in February 2024, of a candidate to \\nsucceed Dr. Heather Munroe -Blum, who retired from the Board \\nafter twelve years of service. The recommended appointment \\nof Dr. Munroe-Blum’s successor is presently pending with the \\nfederal Minister of Finance.\\nAll appointment and re-appointment recommendations \\nare based upon our stringent Director Appointment and \\nReappointment Process described on page 85. This includes \\ntaking into account the Board composition matrix set out on \\npage 87 and the results of our established Board, committee \\nand peer evaluation process, among other factors.\\nThe Governance Committee also oversaw the succession \\nplanning for a new Conduct Review Advisor for CPP Investments \\nin anticipation of the retirement of Sheila Block, who served \\nas CPP Investments’ Conduct Review Advisor for seven \\nyears. On behalf of CPP Investments, I thank Ms. Block for \\nher service. The Conduct Review Advisor role is critical to \\nCPP Investments’ commitment to its guiding principles and \\nMs. Block served admirably. Following a thorough search \\nfor Ms. Block’s successor, the Board appointed Sandra Barton \\nas CPP Investments’ new Conduct Review Advisor effective \\nJanuary 2025. Ms. Barton is a distinguished Canadian litigation \\nlawyer and was assessed by the Board as being eminently \\nqualified for this important role. More information on the Conduct \\nReview Advisor role is provided below on page 92.\\nIn addition, the Governance Committee undertook \\nenhancements to the Board’s Director education program. \\nWhile CPP Investments already had a robust Director education \\nprogram in place, we saw an opportunity to improve the way we \\ntriaged education priorities in view of fast-moving geopolitical \\nand technological shifts. These enhancements ensure our \\neducation program is responsive to CPP Investments’ strategic \\npriorities, emerging risks and is balanced across foundational \\nknowledge, topics of the day and topics of the future. More \\ninformation on our Director education program and recent \\nenhancements is described below on page 87.\\nIn fiscal 2025, the Governance Committee oversaw the delivery \\nof Board education and stakeholder engagement meetings \\nin Alberta as part of our ongoing efforts to develop a more in-\\ndepth understanding of the major regions and sectors in which \\nwe invest. CPP Investments has $14.0 billion invested in Alberta \\nacross public investments, private investments and provincial \\nbonds, making Alberta an important investment region for \\nCPP Investments. The Board’s meetings in Alberta provided an \\nopportunity to engage with several of our Canadian portfolio \\ncompanies and hear directly from the broader business and \\nstakeholder community, including perspectives on opportunities \\nand challenges in the region stemming from recent geopolitical \\nvolatility. The Board also held deep-dive education sessions \\nrelating to energy investing, decarbonization and the global \\nenergy landscape, including sessions with both renewable and \\nconventional energy experts. These meetings, together with \\nthe public meetings that CPP Investments hosts in every region \\nof the country and virtually, also provided an opportunity to \\ndeepen our understanding of the issues and questions that are \\ntop of mind for CPP contributors and beneficiaries. We view \\nthe work of understanding our markets and stakeholders as a \\ncritical part of our commitment to sound governance. \\nMore information on CPP Investments’ approach to governance \\nis provided below.

The Board conducted a scheduled review \\nof Directors’ compensation with the assistance of an external \\nadvisor in fiscal 2024 and will conduct its next scheduled review \\nin fiscal 2026.

Pay Neutrality\\nCompensation alone should not attract or detract desirable candidates.\\n• In reviewing the compensation of CPP Investments Directors, the Board’s objective must be to set a reasonable “threshold” \\nlevel of compensation, which neutralizes compensation so that it is not a significant favourable or unfavourable influence on the \\ndecision of a candidate in joining the CPP Investments Board.\\nII. Public Purpose\\nCanadian governments established CPP Investments with a purpose to serve millions of contributors to the compulsory CPP \\nprogram. Directors’ compensation should reflect a purpose distinct from other commercial organizations oriented to profits \\nand stock price.\\n• While Directors’ compensation should reflect the reality that both the workload and time commitment of a CPP Investments \\nDirectorship, and the expertise and experience required are comparable to private sector directorships, the total pay opportunity \\nfor CPP Investments Directors should reflect our public purpose.\\nIII. Time Commitment\\nThe compensation structure should recognize the differential in time commitment among Directors.\\n• The Board must contemplate and design a compensation structure that takes into account the fact that the CPP Investments \\nBoard is a true ‘working board’ with significant time and travel requirements. Directors are expected to be continuously engaged \\non organizational matters well beyond preparing for, and participating in, frequent Board and Committee meetings. The structure \\nshould recognize the incremental time, travel and meeting commitments expected of each Director, Committee Chairs and the \\nunique role of the Board Chairperson.\\nIV. Relative Benchmark\\nCPP Investments is a complex global investment management organization and is considered a peer relative to other major \\nfinancial institutions and large companies globally.\\n• There is a highly competitive global market for top director talent and the Board must consider how candidates perceive the value \\nproposition of being a CPP Investments Director to recruit and retain top governance talent. For compensation-benchmarking \\npurposes, the Board should consider alternative directorship opportunities available to these candidates in four target talent \\nmarkets: (1) Canadian pension funds and smaller Canadian asset managers; (2) TSX 100 boards and larger Canadian asset \\nmanagers; (3) large Canadian banks and U.S./U.K. asset managers; and (4) global sovereign and pension funds.\\nV. Appropriate Discount to Benchmark\\nA full market-based level of compensation is not appropriate given CPP Investments’ public purpose as described \\nin Principle II.\\n• Upon review of the relative target talent markets for benchmarking purposes, an approximate 20% discount was applied during \\nthe review of compensation in fiscal 2024.\\n 89Annual Report 2025\\nCPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 91, 'page_label': '90'}, page_content='Board and committee meetings\\nThere were eight regularly scheduled Board meetings in fiscal \\n2025, four of which were held in-person.

The \\nBoard has adopted a written Board of Directors Diversity Policy. \\nIt reflects our long-standing belief that CPP Investments is best \\nserved by a Board with a wide array of skills, backgrounds, \\nperspectives and ideas. For purposes of Board composition, \\ndiverse representation considerations include, but are not \\nlimited to, professional experience and expertise, age, gender, \\nethnicity, geographic background, disability status, sexual \\norientation and other personally defining dimensions.\\nThe Board of Directors Diversity Policy applies to both the \\nnomination of new candidates to serve as Directors as well \\nas recommendations for existing Directors to be reappointed \\nto the Board. Under the Policy, when assessing Board \\ncomposition or identifying suitable candidates for appointment \\nor reappointment, the Board or any search committee it \\nestablishes will have due regard to the benefits of ensuring \\ndiversity among the Directors. \\nCurrently, five of 10 CPP Investments Directors (50%) identify \\nas women. Currently, three of 10 Directors (30%) are members \\nof visible minorities.\\nAny search firm engaged to assist the Board with the \\nidentification of candidates for nomination to the Board \\nis directed to the Board of Directors Diversity Policy. The \\nGovernance Committee reviews the Board of Directors \\nDiversity Policy and the Board’s adherence to it annually.\\nSenior Management Team\\nThe importance we place on diversity and inclusion in relation  \\nto our talent practices applies equally at the executive level. The \\nBoard regularly considers diversity in pipeline discussions for \\nsenior leadership positions and implements development plans \\nfor top-performing diverse senior talent. The Board considers \\ngender and non-gender diversity dimensions when appointing \\nCPP Investments Officers.\\nCurrently 6 of 16 (38%) Senior Management Team members \\nidentify as women. Currently 3 of 16 (19%) of Senior \\nManagement Team members identify as members of \\nvisible minorities. \\n 91Annual Report 2025\\nCPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 93, 'page_label': '92'}, page_content='Conduct and culture\\nA culture of integrity and ethical conduct\\nThe Board places utmost importance on fostering an inclusive \\nculture of ethics and integrity throughout CPP Investments.  \\nIt requires and expects Management to support the Board in \\nsetting the tone for a strong governance culture.\\nCode of Conduct and related policies\\nThe Code of Conduct can be found on our website. It outlines \\nwhat is expected of everyone at CPP Investments and our \\naccountability to each other.\\nThe Code sets out strict criteria for the acceptance of any \\nentertainment, gifts or favour. Such benefits must not create \\nor appear to create a favoured position for actual or potential \\ncontractors or suppliers or any party with whom we do \\nbusiness. \\nIt also deals with such matters as conflicts of interest, personal \\nand professional conduct, confidentiality of proprietary \\ninformation, and personal investments.\\nRelated internal policies provide additional information on \\nconflicts of interest and personal investments. These are \\nintended to identify, manage and, where possible, eliminate \\nconflicts of interest relating to Directors and employees. \\nConflicts of interest were anticipated in CPP Investments’ \\nlegislation as a result of the need to recruit Directors and \\nemployees with financial and investment experience. Our \\npolicies are designed to ensure that Directors and employees \\nact in the best interests of the organization. They must disclose \\nany personal or business interests that might lead to a real, \\npotential or perceived conflict of interest. Any involvement \\nin relevant decision-making is prohibited, should those \\ncircumstances arise. Further, Directors are expected to resign \\nfrom the Board if they take on executive responsibilities with an \\norganization whose objectives and mandates may be, or might \\nreasonably be perceived to be, in conflict with CPP Investments’ \\nobjectives or mandate.\\nThese policies also cover the personal trading of \\nCPP Investments Directors and employees. They establish \\nstrict pre-clearance procedures and restrictions on personal \\ntrading in prescribed circumstances.\\nAs part of the hiring process, new recruits must agree to \\ncomply with the Code of Conduct and related conduct policies. \\nCollectively, these set a high standard for promoting ethical \\nconduct and addressing conflicts of interest. Semi-annually, \\nDirectors and employees must reconfirm their compliance and \\nemployees must complete an online module to confirm their \\nunderstanding of the Code and their ability to apply it in day-\\nto-day decisions and actions. The Code also requires everyone \\nat CPP Investments to report it if they become aware of a \\nsuspected breach.\\nGuiding Principles\\nOur Guiding Principles of Integrity, Partnership and High \\nPerformance are embedded in the Code of Conduct. \\nCPP Investments holds annual sessions for all employees  \\nacross all offices to renew their commitment to the Guiding \\nPrinciples and to maintain the focus on this cornerstone of \\nour culture.\\nWhen the Board hires or conducts annual performance reviews \\nof the CEO, it considers the individual’s leadership in promoting \\nethical conduct and championing a culture of Integrity, \\nPartnership and High Performance. These factors are also \\nrelevant in the hiring and review of all employees.\\nConduct Review Advisor\\nTo augment the Code of Conduct, the Board of Directors has \\nappointed an external Conduct Review Advisor to discuss Code \\nof Conduct issues with Directors, employees and relevant third \\nparties on a confidential basis. The Conduct Review Advisor \\nalso assists the Governance Committee with how the Code is \\napplied and in reviewing it for any appropriate changes. \\nSheila Block, a distinguished Canadian lawyer who has \\nserved as the Conduct Review Advisor for the prior seven \\nyears, retired from this position in January 2025. Following a \\nthorough search for her successor, which was overseen by the \\nGovernance Committee, the Board appointed Sandra Barton \\nas CPP Investments’ new Conduct Review Advisor effective \\nJanuary 2, 2025. Ms. Barton is an esteemed Canadian litigation \\nlawyer and was assessed by the Board as being eminently \\nqualified for the Conduct Review Advisor role.\\nThe Conduct Review Advisor submits a report and meets with \\nthe Board at least once a year to discuss their activities.\\n92 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 94, 'page_label': '93'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nBoard of Directors Biographies \\nas at March 31, 2025\\nDEAN CONNOR, CHAIRPERSON1,2*,3*,4*,5*\\nCorporate Director, Toronto, Ontario  \\nDirector since August 2021.  \\nChairperson, Board of Directors.  \\nChair, Investment Strategy Committee.\\nBoard Chair for University Health Network.

Summary of material accounting policies \\nAT A GLANCE\\nThis Note describes material accounting policies that are relevant to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole. Where \\nan accounting policy is specific to one financial statement element, the policy is described in the Note to which it relates.\\nUSE OF ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS\\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions \\nthat affect the amounts recognized for assets and liabilities, principally the valuation of financial instruments which are not actively \\ntraded. Uncertainty about these estimates, judgments and assumptions may result in outcomes that could require a material \\nadjustment to the carrying amount of the affected assets or liabilities in the future.\\nOn April 2, 2025, subsequent to the reporting date, the U.S. administration announced substantial and wide-ranging policy \\nactions. These measures, including retaliatory actions already enacted by other countries and the potential for further trade-\\nrelated developments, have introduced additional uncertainty into the global economic outlook. While no adjustments have \\nbeen made to the Consolidated Financial Statements for events that transpired after March 31, 2025, in accordance with \\nIAS 10 Events After the Reporting Period, CPP Investments has incorporated all available information as of March 31, 2025. \\nCPP Investments is closely monitoring this and other related events and will incorporate any material developments in future \\nreporting periods.\\n1.1 Basis of presentation\\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements present the financial \\nposition and the financial performance of CPP Investments in \\naccordance with IFRS ® Accounting Standards as issued by the \\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\\nCPP Investments qualifies as an investment entity as it meets \\nthe following definition of an investment entity outlined in \\nIFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements  (IFRS 10):\\n• Obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose \\nof providing those investor(s) with investment management \\nservices. In the case of CPP Investments, there is one \\ninvestor (more specifically, CPP Investments invests amounts \\ntransferred from the CPP that are not required to pay current \\nCPP benefits), but the funds are invested in the best interests \\nof a wide group of individuals being the contributors and \\nbeneficiaries of the CPP.\\n• Commits to its investor(s) that its business purpose is to \\ninvest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, \\ninvestment income, or both.\\n• Measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all \\nof its investments on a fair value basis.\\nNo significant judgments or assumptions were made in \\ndetermining that CPP Investments meets the definition of \\nan investment entity as defined in IFRS 10.\\nStatement of compliance\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of CPP Investments \\nhave been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting \\nStandards and the requirements of the CPPIB Act and the \\naccompanying regulations.\\n1.2 Subsidiaries\\nCPP Investments qualifies as an investment entity and reports \\nthe results of its operations in accordance with IFRS 10. \\nAs a consequence, the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nrepresent the results of operations of CPP Investments and \\nits wholly owned subsidiaries that were created to provide \\ninvestment-related services to support its operations. Operating \\nsubsidiaries of this nature include those that provide investment \\nadvisory services or subsidiaries that were created to provide \\nfinancing to CPP Investments.\\nWholly owned subsidiaries that are managed by CPP Investments  \\nto hold investments are referred to herein as investment holding \\nsubsidiaries. Such subsidiaries are not consolidated in these \\nConsolidated Financial Statements but instead are measured \\nand reported at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) in \\naccordance with IFRS 9, Financial Instruments  (IFRS 9). Fair \\nvalue for unconsolidated investment holding subsidiaries \\nis based on the fair value of the underlying investments, \\ninvestment liabilities and pending trades held by the investment \\nholding subsidiary together with its accumulated net income \\nless dividends paid. The determination of the fair value of the \\nunderlying investments and investment liabilities is based on the \\nvaluation techniques and related inputs described in Note 2.\\n1.3 Associates and joint ventures\\nAn associate is an entity in which CPP Investments or its \\ninvestment holding subsidiaries has the ability to exercise \\nsignificant influence over its decision-making.\\nInvestments in joint ventures are those arrangements where \\nCPP Investments or its investment holding subsidiaries have \\njoint control of the arrangements.\\nCPP Investments is an investment entity and measures \\ninvestments in its associates and joint ventures at FVTPL in \\naccordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint \\nVentures (IAS 28) and IFRS 9. \\n 105Annual Report 2025\\nCPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 107, 'page_label': '106'}, page_content='1.4 Financial instruments\\nClassification\\nCPP Investments classifies its financial assets and financial \\nliabilities, in accordance with IFRS 9 as follows:\\nFinancial assets\\nFinancial assets are either classified at FVTPL or at amortized \\ncost. The classification depends on: (a) the business model \\nfor managing the financial assets and (b) the cash flow \\ncharacteristics of the financial assets. Financial assets are \\nclassified at FVTPL on the basis that they are part of a portfolio \\nof investments which is managed to maximize returns without \\nundue risk of loss and whose performance is evaluated on a fair \\nvalue basis in accordance with investment strategies and risk \\nmanagement of CPP Investments. Financial assets classified at \\nFVTPL include investments in equities, debt, investment funds, \\nsecurities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, \\nderivatives and other investment receivables. Financial assets \\ncarried at amortized cost include cash and cash equivalents, \\npending trades receivable, cash collateral pledged on securities \\nborrowed and other assets.\\nFinancial liabilities\\nFinancial liabilities are either classified at FVTPL or at amortized \\ncost. A financial liability is classified at FVTPL if it is classified as \\nheld for trading, or it is designated as such on initial recognition.\\nFinancial liabilities held for trading and classified at FVTPL \\ninclude derivative liabilities and securities sold short. Financial \\nliabilities designated at FVTPL include debt financing liabilities, \\nsecurities and loans sold under repurchase agreements and \\nother investment liabilities. Financial liabilities at amortized cost \\ninclude pending trades payable, cash collateral received on \\nsecurities lent and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\\nRecognition\\nCPP Investments recognizes a financial asset or a financial \\nliability when, and only when, it becomes a party to the \\ncontractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial \\nassets and liabilities are recognized on a trade or settlement \\ndate basis depending on whether there is a time frame \\nestablished by regulation or market convention for delivery \\nof those assets and liabilities.\\nDerecognition\\nA financial asset is derecognized under the following situations: \\n(a) when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from \\nthe financial asset expire, (b) when CPP Investments has \\ntransferred the financial asset and substantially all the risks and \\nrewards of the asset, or (c) when CPP Investments has neither \\nretained substantially all risks and rewards nor control over the \\ntransferred asset.\\nCPP Investments derecognizes a financial liability when the \\nobligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.\\nInitial measurement\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are measured on initial \\nrecognition at fair value.\\nSubsequent measurement\\nAfter initial measurement, financial assets and financial \\nliabilities continue to be measured at fair value or amortized \\ncost.

Cash equivalents includes term \\ndeposits, commercial paper, bank accepted bills, deposit notes \\nand treasury bills, all of which have a maturity date of 90 days or \\nless from the acquisition date.\\nFair value is determined using cost, which, together with \\naccrued interest income, approximates fair value due to the \\nshort-term or floating rate nature of these assets.\\n2.2 Equities\\nPrivate equities\\nPrivate equities are composed of ownership in private \\ncompanies. Private equity investments are generally made \\ndirectly or through a co-investment structure.\\nFair value for investments held directly is primarily determined \\nusing accepted industry valuation methods such as earnings \\nmultiples of comparable publicly traded companies or \\ndiscounted cash flows. Significant inputs for these valuation \\nmethods include company-specific inputs such as earnings \\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), \\nearnings multiples of comparable publicly traded companies, \\nprojected cash flows, discount rates using current market yields \\nof instruments with similar characteristics, net operating income, \\ndiscount and terminal capitalization rates.

Fair value measurement\\nAT A GLANCE\\nIn an active market, fair value is best evidenced by an independent quoted market price. In the absence of an active market, \\nfair value can be significantly more complex and often subjective, requiring judgment.\\nThis Note categorizes the fair value of investments and investment liabilities within the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. For \\nfair value estimates that require significant judgment, the Note further provides the roll-forward of these investments during the \\nyear and the range of valuation techniques and inputs used.\\nInvestments and investment liabilities owned by investment holding subsidiaries are held indirectly by CPP Investments. The \\nfair value of each investment holding subsidiary is determined based on the fair value of the underlying investments held, net \\nof any investment liabilities and pending trades together with its accumulated net income less dividends paid. Further detail \\non investment holding subsidiaries is provided in Note 3.2.\\nACCOUNTING POLICY\\nThe fair value of CPP Investments’ investments and investment liabilities is categorized into the following fair value hierarchy \\nbased on the level of significant inputs used in the fair value measurement:\\n• Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n• Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly \\n(as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and\\n• Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\\nSIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES\\nLevel 3 investments consist of instruments held at fair value that are not traded or quoted in active markets. Fair value is, \\ntherefore, determined using valuation techniques that use models with unobservable inputs while maximizing the use of inputs \\nobserved from markets. The resulting values are particularly judgmental. Refer to Note 3.4 and Note 3.5 for the valuation \\ntechniques used to determine the fair value of Level 3 investments and sensitivity analysis including reasonably possible \\nalternative inputs.\\n 111Annual Report 2025\\nCPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 -

Through these breakdowns, information is provided regarding the extent to which different types of derivatives are used.\\n4.1 Fair value of derivatives\\nDerivatives generate positive or negative value, as the value of \\nunderlying assets, indexes, interest rates, currency exchange \\nrates or other market-based factors change such that the \\npreviously contracted terms of the derivative transactions have \\nbecome more or less favourable than what can be negotiated \\nunder current market conditions for contracts with the same \\nterms and remaining period to expiry.\\nThe derivative-related market risk is a component of the total \\nportfolio market risk, which is managed through the Risk Policy \\ndescribed in Note 7.\\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the \\npositive fair value of the derivative and is normally a small \\nfraction of the contract’s notional amount. Negotiated over-\\nthe-counter derivatives that are not centrally cleared generally \\npresent greater credit exposure than exchange-traded \\ncontracts. Credit risk on exchange-traded or centrally cleared \\ncontracts is limited because these transactions are either \\nexecuted on regulated exchanges or settled through well-\\ncapitalized clearing houses that assume the obligation of the \\nwriter of a contract and guarantee their performance. \\n 121Annual Report 2025\\nCPP Investments'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 123, 'page_label': '122'}, page_content='The fair value of derivative contracts held by CPP Investments and its investment holding subsidiaries is as follows:\\nAs at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024\\n(CAD millions)\\nPositive  \\nfair value\\nNegative  \\nfair value\\nPositive  \\nfair value\\nNegative  \\nfair value\\nEquity contracts\\nFutures $ – $ – $ 3 $ –\\nSwaps 1,745 (1,928) 1,806 (1,730)\\nOptions:\\nOver-the-counter – purchased 5 – 1 –\\nOver-the-counter – written – (133) – (114)\\nWarrants1 19 – 5 –\\nTotal equity contracts 1,769 (2,061) 1,815 (1,844)\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nForeign exchange forwards 430 (3,043) 701 (1,135)\\nOptions:\\nOver-the-counter – purchased 42 – 43 –\\nOver-the-counter – written – (47) – (36)\\nTotal foreign exchange contracts 472 (3,090) 744 (1,171)\\nInterest rate contracts\\nFutures – – – –\\nSwaps 14 (280) 7 (396)\\nOptions:\\nExchange-traded – written – (9) – (7)\\nOver-the-counter – purchased 344 – 315 –\\nOver-the-counter – written – (179) – (112)\\nTotal interest rate contracts 358 (468) 322 (515)\\nCredit contracts\\nCredit default swaps:\\nOver-the-counter – purchased – (7) 2 (25)\\nOver-the-counter – written 17 (3) 77 (2)\\nOptions:\\nOver-the-counter – purchased 3 – 2 –\\nOver-the-counter – written – (25) – (18)\\nTotal credit contracts 20 (35) 81 (45)\\nCommodity contracts\\nFutures – – – –\\nOptions:\\nExchange-traded – purchased – – – –\\nExchange-traded – written – (65) – (72)\\nTotal commodity contracts – (65) – (72)\\nTotal $ 2,619 $ (5,719) $ 2,962 $ (3,647)\\n1.

Risk management \\nAT A GLANCE\\nThe base CPP Investment Portfolio and additional CPP Investment Portfolio (collectively the Investment Portfolios) are exposed \\nto a variety of investment risks which are managed through the Risk Policy. The underlying risk categories, exposures and the \\nrelated risk management techniques are described in the following Notes:\\n• Note 8 – Market risk\\n• Note 9 – Credit risk\\n• Note 10 – Liquidity and leverage risk\\nAny references to the investment activities and risk exposures of CPP Investments also include those of its unconsolidated \\ninvestment holding subsidiaries.\\nCPP Investments remains within all risk limits established by its Board of Directors, including limits related to market, credit, \\nliquidity and leverage risks.\\n7.1 Introduction\\nCPP Investments manages investment risks in accordance with \\nthe Risk Policy (Policy). This Policy establishes accountability \\nof the Board of Directors, the various committees, including \\nthe Risk Committee, and departments to manage investment-\\nrelated risks. The Policy is updated and approved by the Board \\nof Directors at least once every fiscal year, and contains risk \\nappetite (in the form of limits, statements and targets) and risk \\nmanagement provisions that govern investment decisions \\nin accordance with CPP Investments’ mandate. Effective \\nApril 1, 2024, the Board of Directors approved changes to \\ncertain investment risk measures which are further described \\nin Note 7.2 and 10.1.\\nUpper and lower risk limits are included within the Policy, \\nand these govern the amount of total investment risk that \\nCPP Investments can take in the Investment Portfolios. \\nCPP Investments monitors potential investment losses in \\nthe Investment Portfolios daily and reports to the Board of \\nDirectors on at least a quarterly basis. The Market Risk Target \\n(previously called the Reference Portfolio) for each of the base \\nCPP Investment Portfolio and additional CPP Investment \\nPortfolio is assessed using an equity/debt risk equivalence ratio, \\nwhich is the proportion of equity versus debt in a simple two-\\nasset class representation of Canadian Government Bonds and \\nGlobal Public Equities (including Canada) that would give the \\nsame market and credit risk as that of the applicable Investment \\nPortfolio. Each Investment Portfolio’s ratio must be within the \\nBoard of Directors’ approved risk limits.\\n7.1.1 Independent risk oversight\\nThe Risk department within CPP Investments reports to the \\nChief Risk Officer. The function is responsible for assessing, \\nmonitoring and ensuring management of the Investment \\nPortfolios is consistent with the established risk appetites. \\nThis oversight is exercised through independent control and \\nsupport functions. Investment departments are accountable \\nfor managing risk within prescribed risk appetites.\\n7.1.2 Investment risk measures\\nA suite of measures is used to estimate the risk of loss from \\nsmall, moderate and significant market moves over various time \\nhorizons. In addition to industry standard market and credit risk \\nmodels, CPP Investments uses proprietary models to assess \\npotential losses to the portfolio over longer time horizons. \\nFurthermore, a number of investment strategy specific risk \\nmeasures are tracked that are related to the specific nature \\nof the strategy.\\n7.1.3 Stress scenario analysis\\nTo complement the suite of potential loss measures used to \\nmonitor the Investment Portfolios, CPP Investments further \\nexamines the potential impact of extreme but plausible adverse \\nmarket events. Scenario analysis considers the effect of various \\nmarket stress events, including potential geopolitical or adverse \\neconomic events, using a bottom-up approach that considers \\nthe effect of parameter shocks across the entire portfolio. These \\nassessments are reported to both Senior Management and the \\nBoard of Directors.\\n7.1.4 Model validation\\nThe model validation function within the Risk department \\nindependently validates strategically important portfolio \\nconstruction and risk management models as well as valuation \\nmethodologies within the main investment systems. A risk-\\nbased approach is used to establish the frequency and depth \\nof the validation activities, with increased focus on higher \\nrisk models.\\n7.2 Total fund risk\\nA suite of risk measures is used within CPP Investments to \\nmonitor and assess the risk profile of the Investment Portfolios. \\nRegular risk reports are provided to senior management \\nand the Board of Directors to support the governance of the \\nvarious dimensions of risk to which the Investment Portfolios \\nare exposed.\\n126 CPP Investments\\nAnnual Report 2025'),\n"," Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 20.2 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2025-05-16T12:30:28-04:00', 'keywords': 'Annual Report 2025 - Investing for Canadians', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_actionid': '47a8f9e0-50e8-435f-9e93-ca3a4f4f2a14', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_enabled': 'True', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_extended_msft_method': 'Standard', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_name': 'Restricted', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_removed': 'False', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_setdate': '2025-05-16T21:17:41Z', 'msip_label_13a007dd-a2d6-4865-aec1-77b98e8391ea_siteid': '43c7fa0d-fe1f-4201-980b-3d9be41913e3', 'moddate': '2025-05-16T17:20:27-04:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'annual_report_2025.pdf', 'total_pages': 146, 'page': 128, 'page_label': '127'}, page_content='Strategy Management’s Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nGovernanceConsolidated Financial  \\nStatements and Notes\\nCompensation Discussion \\nand Analysis\\nKey investment risk measures include:\\n• Market risk: The target level of market risk, expressed in \\nterms of an equity/debt risk equivalence ratio, which is the \\nproportion of equity (versus debt) in a simple two-asset class \\nrepresentation of Canadian Government Bonds and Global \\nPublic Equities (including Canada) that would give the same \\nmarket risk as that of the applicable Investment Portfolio. \\nThe target level of market risk of the base CPP Investment \\nPortfolio is currently set at 85%/15%, with associated limits \\nof 80%-90%, while the additional CPP Investment Portfolio \\ntarget level is set at 55%/45%, with associated limits \\nof 50%-60%.\\n• Potential investment loss: The loss of the Investment Portfolios \\nover a one-year horizon is not expected to exceed the \\nestablished limit 19 times out of 20.\\n• Liquidity and leverage risk measures, which are further \\ndescribed in Note 10.\\nThe monitoring of adherence to investment risk limits is \\nconducted independent of the investment departments by \\nthe Risk department, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer, using \\nboth industry standard and internally developed risk models. \\nThe tables below provide a summary of the key investment risk \\nmeasures of the Investment Portfolios.\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2025\\nAs at \\nMarch 31, 2024 3\\nLimits base CPP base CPP\\nMarket risk1 80 – 90% 84% 82%\\nOne-year potential investment loss1,2 14 – 18% 17% 16%\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2025\\nAs at \\nMarch 31, 2024 3\\nLimits additional CPP additional CPP\\nMarket risk1 50 – 60% 53% 52%\\nOne-year potential investment loss1,2 10 – 13% 12% 11%\\n1.

This includes the foreign currency gains \\ntypically realized in market stresses, where the Canadian \\ndollar depreciates against the U.S. dollar. CPP Investments \\nestimates if an event like the GFC were to recur, it would result \\nin losses of approximately 11% or $77 billion. \\n• Inflation and rates – In this scenario, CPP Investments applies \\nchanges observed during the 2022 interest rate hike cycle. \\nDuring that time, bonds and equities sold off in tandem as \\ncentral banks rapidly raised interest rates to seek to bring \\ninflation under control. CPP Investments estimates that if an \\nevent like the 2022 rate hike cycle were to recur, it would result \\nin losses of approximately 8% or $59 billion.\\nAd hoc analysis is also performed on various plausible stress \\nscenarios based on current global events, such as inflation \\nshocks, potential impacts of economic and regulatory policies, \\nthe U.S. administration’s policy actions, China-U.S. geopolitical \\ntensions, and bank credit crisis scenarios.

Market risk \\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of an investment or \\ninvestment liability will fluctuate because of changes in market \\nprices and rates, which includes equity prices, interest rates, \\ncredit spreads and currency exchange rates.\\nCPP Investments uses a tiered structure of limits to govern \\nmarket risk by controlling the size of risk exposures.

Market risk is \\nalso incorporated as a component of the potential investment \\nloss measure in Note 7.2. These measures are supplemented \\nwith drawdown or reported loss thresholds that highlight any \\npublic market strategies that are experiencing losses greater \\nthan their estimated market risk levels. More granular limits are \\nalso used in certain cases that are investment strategy specific \\nand are tailored to the way that the strategies are managed on \\na daily basis. Examples of such granular limits and measures \\ninclude: DV01 which measures the possible loss/gain in the \\ninvestment strategy as a result of a 1 basis point increase/\\ndecrease in interest rate yield curves, and divergence limits that \\ntrack the risks against the limits’ respective benchmarks.\\nInvestment departments are expected to stay within their limits \\nbut are allowed to request increases to management level limits. \\nAny limit excesses are processed according to established \\nescalation guidelines.\\nMarket risk includes equity risk, interest rate risk, credit \\nspread risk and currency risk.

In this lateral view of the human brain, the frontal lobe is at the left, the occipital lobe at the right, and the temporal and parietal lobes have largely been removed to reveal one of the hippocampi underneath.Hippocampus (lowest pink region) as part of the limbic systemDetailsPart ofTemporal lobeIdentifiersLatinhippocampusMeSHD006624NeuroNames3157NeuroLex IDbirnlex_721TA98A14.1.09.321TA25518FMA275020Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy[edit on Wikidata]\\nThe hippocampus (pl.: hippocampi; via Latin from Greek ἱππόκαμπος, \\'seahorse\\'), also hippocampus proper,  is a major component of the brain of humans and many other vertebrates. In the human brain the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum are components of the hippocampal formation located in the limbic system. \\nThe hippocampus plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. In humans and other primates the hippocampus is located in the archicortex, one of the three regions of allocortex, in each hemisphere with direct neural projections to,  and reciprocal indirect projections from the neocortex. The hippocampus, as the medial pallium, is a structure found in all vertebrates.\\nIn Alzheimer\\'s disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be damaged; short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy. People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia: the inability to form and retain new memories.\\nSince different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was initially discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed to be one of the main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.\\nIn rodents as model organisms, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation. Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampi respond as place cells: that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment. Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.\\n\\n\\nName\\nThe human hippocampus and fornix (left) compared with a seahorse (right)[1]\\nThe earliest description of the ridge running along the floor of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle comes from the Venetian anatomist Julius Caesar Aranzi (1587), who likened it first to a silkworm and then to a seahorse (Latin hippocampus, from Greek ἱππόκαμπος, from ἵππος, \\'horse\\' + κάμπος, \\'sea monster\\').[2] The German anatomist Duvernoy (1729), the first to illustrate the structure, also wavered between \"seahorse\" and \"silkworm\". \"Ram\\'s horn\" was proposed by the Danish anatomist Jacob Winsløw in 1732; and a decade later his fellow Parisian, the surgeon de Garengeot, used cornu Ammonis – horn of Amun,[3] after the ancient Egyptian god who was often represented as having a ram\\'s head.[4] Ammon is the Greek name for Amun.[5]\\nThe head region of the hippocampus is enlarged, and presents two or three rounded elevations or foot-like digitations, and hence it was named the pes hippocampi (pes meaning foot).[6][7] Later this part was described as pes hippocampi major, with an adjacent bulge in the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle, described as pes hippocampi minor later renamed as the calcar avis.[3][8] In 1786 Félix Vicq-d\\'Azyr published an authoritative description naming just the hippocampus but the term remained largely unused with no description of any function proposed until in the middle of the 20th century it was associated with memory.[2]\\nMayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by some other authors until Karl Friedrich Burdach resolved this error in 1829. In 1861 the hippocampus minor became the center of a dispute over human evolution between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen, satirized as the Great Hippocampus Question. The term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks and was officially removed in the Nomina Anatomica of 1895.[9] Today, the structure is just called the hippocampus, with the term cornu Ammonis (that is, \\'Ammon\\'s horn\\')  surviving in the names of the hippocampal subfields CA1–CA4.[10][11][12]\\n\\nIn the limbic system\\nHippocampus in the limbic system\\nThe hippocampus is one of the structures of the limbic lobe, first described by Broca in 1878, as the cortical areas that line the deep edge of the cerebral cortex.[13] The limbic lobe is the main component of the limbic system.[14] The cingulate gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus are the two main parts of the described lobe, which had been largely associated with olfaction.[13] Many studies later culminating in work by Papez, and MacLean, the involvement of other interacting brain regions associated with emotion was recognized.[14] The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior, including the septal area, the hypothalamic mammillary bodies, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus. MacLean proposed that the associated structures of the limbic lobe be included in what he termed as the limbic system.[14]\\n\\nAnatomy\\nSee also: Hippocampus anatomy\\n Cross-section of cerebral hemisphere showing structure and location of hippocampus\\n Coronal section of the brain of a macaque monkey, showing hippocampal formation  (circled)\\nThe hippocampus is a five centimeter long ridge of gray matter tissue within the parahippocampal gyrus that can only be seen when the gyrus is opened up.[15][16] The hippocampus is an inward fold of three-layered  archicortex (one of three regions of the allocortex) into the medial temporal lobe of the brain, where it elevates into the floor of each lateral ventricle inferior horn.[17][18][19][20] The hippocampus stretches along its anterior-posterior axis, from the amygdala to the splenium of the corpus callosum, with the head, body, and tail regions as subdivisions of this axis.[21][15] The dentate gyrus, CA subfields, fimbria, and subiculum are divisions across the short axis, the proximal-distal axis.[21]\\nThe hippocampal formation refers to the hippocampus, and its related adjoining parts to include the dentate gyrus, the subiculum, the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex.[17] Sometimes the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum are grouped together as the subicular complex, but the regions are neuroanatomically distinct. Some sources may only include the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and subiculum, being regions of the hippocampal three-layered archicortex.[17] But the six regions are linked together serially by almost unidirectional neural pathways.[17] Other sources include the indusium griseum, gyrus fasciolaris, the medial and longitudinal striae, and uncus, and exclude subicular regions.[22][23] The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.[19]\\nThe hippocampus has a generally similar appearance across the range of mammals, from egg-laying mammals such as the echidna, to humans and other primates.[24] The hippocampal-size-to-body-size ratio broadly increases, being about twice as large for primates as for the echidna. It does not, however, increase at anywhere close to the rate of the neocortex-to-body-size ratio. Therefore, the hippocampus takes up a much larger fraction of the cortical mantle in rodents than in primates. In adult humans the volume of the hippocampus on each side of the brain is about 3.0 to 3.5\\xa0cm3 as compared to 320 to 420\\xa0cm3 for the volume of the neocortex.[25] There is also a general relationship between the size of the hippocampus and spatial memory. When comparisons are made between similar species, those that have a greater capacity for spatial memory tend to have larger hippocampal volumes.[26]\\n\\nNeuroanatomy\\nThe hippocampus, and dentate gyrus that is folded into the hippocampal archicortex have the shape of a curved, rolled-up tube. The curve of the hippocampus  (known as cornu Ammonis) uses the initial letters CA to name the hippocampal subfields CA1-CA4. CA4 is in fact the polymorphic layer or hilus of the dentate gyrus, but CA4 is still sometimes in use to describe the part of CA3 that inserts between the dentate gyrus regions or blades.[17][27]\\nIt can be distinguished as an area where the cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons, which curl into a tight U shape. One edge of the \"U,\" – (CA4) the hilus of the dentate gyrus, is embedded into the backward-facing, flexed dentate gyrus. In humans the hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part; in other primates they are termed rostral and caudal, and in rodent literature they are the  ventral and dorsal part.[28] Both parts are of similar composition but belong to different neural circuits.[29] The dentate gyrus combined with other hippocampal regions form a banana-like structure, with the two hippocampi joined at the stems by the commissure of fornix (also called the hippocampal commissure).[19][30] In primates, the part of the hippocampus at the bottom, near the base of the temporal lobe, is much broader than the part at the top. This means that in cross-section the hippocampus can show a number of different shapes, depending on the angle and location of the cut.[31]\\nIn a cross-section of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, several layers will be shown. The dentate gyrus has three layers of cells – the outer molecular layer, the middle granular layer, and the inner polymorphic layer also known as the hilus.[32] The CA3 subfield has the following cell layers known as strata: lacunosum-moleculare, radiatum, lucidum, pyramidal, and oriens. CA2 and CA1 also have these layers except the lucidum stratum.[33]\\nThe input to the hippocampus (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) comes from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path.[34] The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures as well as with the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus,[35] the supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.[34]\\nThe EC is located in the parahippocampal gyrus, a cortical region adjacent to the hippocampus.[36] This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus is adjacent to the perirhinal cortex, which plays an important role in the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.[36]\\n\\nCircuitry\\n Basic circuit of the hippocampus, as drawn by Ramón y Cajal. DG: dentate gyrus. Sub: subiculum. EC: entorhinal cortex\\nThe major input to the hippocampus is through the entorhinal cortex (EC), whereas its major output is via CA1 to the subiculum.[37] Information reaches CA1 via two main pathways, direct and indirect. Axons from the EC that originate in layer III are the origin of the direct perforant pathway and form synapses on the very distal apical dendrites of CA1 neurons. Conversely, axons originating from layer II are the origin of the indirect pathway, and information reaches CA1 via the trisynaptic circuit. In the initial part of this pathway, the axons project through the perforant pathway to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (first synapse). From then, the information follows via the mossy cell fibers to CA3 (second synapse). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1 (third synapse).[37] Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex, completing the circuit.[38]\\nBasket cells in CA3 receive excitatory input from the pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells give a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.[39]\\nSeveral other connections play important roles in hippocampal function.[19] Beyond the output to the EC, additional output pathways go to other cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. A major output goes via the fornix to the lateral septal area and to the mammillary body of the hypothalamus (which the fornix interconnects with the hippocampus).[16] The hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, and from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus to field CA1. A very important projection comes from the medial septal nucleus, which sends cholinergic, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) stimulating fibers (GABAergic fibers) to all parts of the hippocampus. The inputs from the medial septal nucleus play a key role in controlling the physiological state of the hippocampus; destruction of this nucleus abolishes the hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory.[40]\\n\\nSubfields\\n Hippocampal subregions, and subfields\\n Drawing by Italian pathologist Camillo Golgi of a hippocampus stained using silver nitrate\\nHippocampal subfields, and subregions, head, body, and tail, are functionally and anatomically differentiated, and connect differently to other brain regions.[41][42] Their cells are morphologically different.[43] They also have different levels of vulnerability to disease.[41]\\nIn humans the head of the hippocampus is termed the anterior hippocampus, the body is the intermediate hippocampus, and the tail the posterior hippocampus. The subregions all serve different functions, project with different neural pathways, and have varying numbers of place cells.[44] (In other primates the terms used are rostral and caudal, and in rodents they are termed ventral and dorsal).[28] The posterior hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze in rats, lesions in the dorsal hippocampus were shown to cause spatial memory impairment. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus, and supramammillary nucleus.[45] In the rat the dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.[46]\\nIn the early 20th century, the widely held view was that olfaction was a major hippocampal function.[47] This view was argued against, pointing out that the hippocampus was present in some animals such as dolphins and whales, that did not have a sense of smell; and further that lesions in the temporal lobe in dogs had been shown to have no effect on their sense of smell.[47] These arguments were concluded in 1947 and held for a few more decades. In 1984, and 1987, studies in the rat showed that the entorhinal cortex receives substantial input from the olfactory bulb, with part of the EC being directly innervated by the lateral olfactory tract.[47] Secondary inputs to the EC were also shown to include some from the periamygdaloid and piriform cortices, and CA1 in the ventral hippocampus was shown to sends axons to the main olfactory bulb.[48][47] It is evident that the hippocampus does have an involvement in memory for odors.[49][50]\\nThe intermediate hippocampus has overlapping characteristics with both the ventral and dorsal hippocampus.[44] Studies in 2002, showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced the amount of information sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.[51] In 2007, studies using anterograde tracing methods, located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes.[52]\\n\\nFunction\\nTheories\\nThree main theories of hippocampal function have been in dominance: response inhibition, episodic memory, and spatial cognition. The response inhibition theory (caricatured by John O\\'Keefe and Lynn Nadel as \"slam on the brakes!\") was very popular up to the 1960s.[53]  It was based largely on two observations: first, that animals with hippocampal damage tend to be hyperactive; second, that animals with hippocampal damage often have difficulty learning to inhibit previously learnt responses, especially if the response requires remaining quiet as in a passive avoidance test. British psychologist Jeffrey Gray developed this line of thought into a complete theory of the role of the hippocampus in anxiety, called the behavioral inhibition system.[54][55]\\nThe second major line of thought relates the hippocampus to memory. Although it had historical precursors, this idea derived its main impetus from a famous report by American neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville and British-Canadian neuropsychologist Brenda Milner.[56] It described the results of surgical destruction of the hippocampi when trying to relieve epileptic seizures in an American man Henry Molaison, known until his death in 2008 as \"Patient H.M.\"[57][58] The unexpected outcome of the surgery was severe anterograde, and partial retrograde amnesia; Molaison was unable to form new episodic memories after his surgery and could not remember any events that occurred just before his surgery, but he did retain memories of events that occurred many years earlier extending back into his childhood. This case attracted such widespread professional interest that Molaison became the most intensively studied subject in medical history.[57]\\n\\nRats and cognitive maps\\nThe third important theory of hippocampal function relates the hippocampus to space, and spatial memory, with the idea of a cognitive map first proposed by American psychologist E.C. Tolman. This theory was followed further by O\\'Keefe, and in 1971, he and his student Dostrovsky discovered neurons, in the rat hippocampus that seemed to show activity related to the rat\\'s location within its environment. The neurons were described as place cells.[59] A book was later produced in 1978, The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map written by O\\'Keefe and Nadel.[60] It has been generally agreed that the hippocampus plays a key role in spatial coding but the details are widely debated.[61]\\nResearch has focused on trying to bridge the disconnect between the two main views of hippocampal function as being split between memory and spatial cognition. In some studies, these areas have been expanded to the point of near convergence. In an attempt to reconcile the two disparate views, it is suggested that a broader view of the hippocampal function is taken and seen to have a role that encompasses both the organization of experience (mental mapping, as per Tolman\\'s original concept in 1948) and the directional behavior seen as being involved in all areas of cognition, so that the function of the hippocampus can be viewed as a broader system that incorporates both the memory and the spatial perspectives in its role that involves the use of a wide scope of cognitive maps.[62][63][64][65] This relates to the purposive behaviorism born of Tolman\\'s original goal of identifying the complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behavior.[66]\\nIt has also been proposed that the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated spatially, and it was suggested that the mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their neuronal algorithms were basically the same.[67]\\nMany studies have made use of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a functional role in approach-avoidance conflict has been noted. The anterior hippocampus is seen to be involved in decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict processing. It is suggested that the memory, spatial cognition, and conflict processing functions may be seen as working together and not mutually exclusive.[68]\\n\\nRole in memory\\nSee also: Amnesia and Epigenetics in learning and memory\\nThe hippocampus is essential for the formation of explicit memory, also known as declarative memory. Episodic memory, and semantic memory are the two components of explicit memory.\\n[69]\\nThe hippocampus also encodes emotional context from the amygdala. This is partly why returning to a location where an emotional event occurred may evoke that emotion. There is a deep emotional connection between episodic memories and places.[70]\\nDue to bilateral symmetry the brain has a hippocampus in each cerebral hemisphere. If damage to the hippocampus occurs in only one hemisphere, leaving the structure intact in the other hemisphere, the brain can retain near-normal memory functioning.[71] Severe damage to the hippocampi in both hemispheres results in profound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia) and often also affects memories formed before the damage occurred (retrograde amnesia). Although the retrograde effect normally extends many years back before the brain damage, in some cases older memories remain. This retention of older memories leads to the idea that consolidation over time involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus to other parts of the brain.[72]:\\u200aCh. 1\\u200a Experiments using intrahippocampal transplantation of hippocampal cells in primates with neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus have shown that the hippocampus is required for the formation and recall, but not the storage, of memories.[73] It has been shown that a decrease in the volume of various parts of the hippocampus leads to specific memory impairments. In particular, efficiency of verbal memory retention is related to the anterior parts of the right and left hippocampus. The right head of the hippocampus is more involved in executive functions and regulation during verbal memory recall. The tail of the left hippocampus tends to be closely related to verbal memory capacity.[74]\\nDamage to the hippocampus does not affect some types of memory, such as the ability to learn new skills (playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles, for example). This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory such as procedural memory in implicit memory function, implicating different brain regions. Furthermore, amnesic patients frequently show implicit memory for experiences even in the absence of conscious knowledge. For example, patients asked to guess which of two faces they have seen most recently may give the correct answer most of the time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of the faces before. Some researchers distinguish between conscious recollection, which depends on the hippocampus, and familiarity, which depends on portions of the medial temporal lobe.[75] A study claims to have confirmed that the hippocampus is not associated with implicit memory.[76] But other sources say the question is still up for debate (as of 2024).[77]\\nWhen rats are exposed to an intense learning event, they may retain a life-long memory of the event even after a single training session. The memory of such an event appears to be first stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex.[78] When such an intense learning event was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one hour and at 24 hours after training.[79] These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines (5mCs) in DNA. Demethylation of 5mC can be carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including TET enzymes[80][81] as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway.[82]\\n\\nBetween systems model\\nThe between-systems memory interference model describes the inhibition of non-hippocampal systems of memory during concurrent hippocampal activity.[83]  Specifically it was found that when the hippocampus was inactive, non-hippocampal systems located elsewhere in the brain were found to consolidate memory in its place. However, when the hippocampus was reactivated, memory traces consolidated by non-hippocampal systems were not recalled, suggesting that the hippocampus interferes with long-term memory consolidation in other memory-related systems.[84]\\nOne of the major implications that this model illustrates is the dominant effects of the hippocampus on non-hippocampal networks when information is incongruent. With this information in mind, future directions could lead towards the study of these non-hippocampal memory systems through hippocampal inactivation, further expanding the labile constructs of memory. Additionally, many theories of memory are holistically based around the hippocampus. This model could add beneficial information to hippocampal research and memory theories such as the multiple trace theory.[85][86] Lastly, the between-system memory interference model allows researchers to evaluate their results on a multiple-systems model, suggesting that some effects may not be simply mediated by one portion of the brain.[87]\\n\\nRole in spatial memory and navigation\\nMain article: Place cell\\n Spatial firing patterns of eight place cells recorded from the CA1 layer of a rat. The rat ran back and forth along an elevated track, stopping at each end to eat a small food reward. Dots indicate positions where action potentials were recorded, with color indicating which neuron emitted that action potential.\\nHippocampal connections in spatial cognition\\nThere are several types of navigational cells in the brain that are either in the hippocampus itself or are strongly connected to it. They include the place cells, speed cells present in the medial entorhinal cortex, head direction cells, grid cells, and boundary cells.[61][88] Together these cells form a network that serves as spatial memory.\\nThe first of these types of cell discovered in the 1970s were the place cells, which led to the idea of the hippocampus acting to give a neural representation of the environment in a cognitive map.[60] When the hippocampus is dysfunctional, orientation is affected; people may have difficulty in remembering how they arrived at a location and how to proceed further. Getting lost is a common symptom of amnesia.[89] Studies with animals have shown that an intact hippocampus is required for initial learning and long-term retention of some spatial memory tasks, in particular ones that require finding the way to a hidden goal.[90][91][92][93]\\nStudies on freely moving rats and mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a particular location.[94]\\nHippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.[95] Speed cells are thought to provide input to the hippocampal grid cells.[96] This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair.[97] However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather than to its actual location in the room.[98] Over many years, many studies have been carried out on place-responses in rodents, which have given a large amount of information.[61] Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons, and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate that are much weaker. There is little, if any, spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells lying next to each other in the hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat\\'s location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment.[61] In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other task-related variables.[99] The firing of place cells is timed in relation to local theta waves, a spatiotemporal  process termed phase precession.[100][101]\\nCells with location-specific firing patterns have been reported during a study of people with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize the source of their seizures, with a view to surgical resection. They had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampi and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town.[102] Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active.[103] A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London\\'s black cab drivers need to learn the locations of a large number of places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.[104] Another study showed opposite findings in blind individuals. The anterior part of the right hippocampus was larger and the posterior part was smaller, compared with sighted individuals.[105]\\n\\nRole in approach-avoidance conflict processing\\nFurther information: Reward system\\nApproach-avoidance conflict happens when a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making has been associated with anxiety.[106] fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision-making in uncertain conditions.[106]\\nA review makes reference to a number of studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that one challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.[68]\\n\\nRole in social memory\\nFurther information: Collective memory\\nThe hippocampus has received renewed attention for its role in social memory. Epileptic human subjects with depth electrodes in the left posterior, left anterior or right anterior hippocampus demonstrate distinct, individual cell responses when presented with faces of presumably recognizable famous people.[107] Associations among facial and vocal identity were similarly mapped to the hippocampus of rhesus monkeys. Single neurons in the CA1 and CA3 responded strongly to social stimulus recognition by MRI. The CA2 was not distinguished, and may likely comprise a proportion of the claimed CA1 cells in the study.[108] The dorsal CA2 and ventral CA1 subregions of the hippocampus have been implicated in social memory processing. Genetic inactivation of CA2 pyramidal neurons leads to pronounced loss of social memory, while maintaining intact sociability in mice.[109] Similarly, ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons have also been demonstrated as critical for social memory under optogenetic control in mice.[110][111]\\n\\nPhysiology\\n Examples of rat hippocampal EEG and CA1 neural activity in the theta (awake/behaving) and LIA (slow-wave sleep) modes. Each plot shows 20 seconds of data, with a hippocampal EEG trace at the top, spike rasters from 40 simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells in the middle (each raster line represents a different cell), and a plot of running speed at the bottom. The top plot represents a time period during which the rat was actively searching for scattered food pellets. For the bottom plot the rat was asleep.\\nThe hippocampus shows two major modes of activity, each associated with a distinct pattern of neural population activity and waves of electrical activity as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG). These modes are named after the EEG patterns associated with them: theta and large irregular activity (LIA). The main characteristics described below are for the rat, which is the animal most extensively studied.[112]\\nThe theta mode appears during states of active, alert behavior (especially locomotion), and also during REM sleep (dreaming).[113] In the theta mode, the EEG is dominated by large regular waves with a frequency range of 6 to 9 Hz, and the main groups of hippocampal neurons (pyramidal cells and granule cells) show sparse population activity, which means that in any short time interval, the great majority of cells are silent, while the small remaining fraction fire at relatively high rates, up to 50 spikes in one second for the most active of them.[114][115] An active cell typically stays active for half a second to a few seconds. As the rat behaves, the active cells fall silent and new cells become active, but the overall percentage of active cells remains more or less constant. In many situations, cell activity is determined largely by the spatial location of the animal,[116] but other behavioral variables also clearly influence it.\\nThe LIA mode appears during slow-wave sleep (non-dreaming), and also during states of waking immobility such as resting or eating.[113] In the LIA mode, the EEG is dominated by sharp waves that are randomly timed large deflections of the EEG signal lasting for 25–50 milliseconds. Sharp waves are frequently generated in sets, with sets containing up to 5 or more individual sharp waves and lasting up to 500 ms. The spiking activity of neurons within the hippocampus is highly correlated with sharp wave activity. Most neurons decrease their firing rate between sharp waves; however, during a sharp wave, there is a dramatic increase in firing rate in up to 10% of the hippocampal population.[117]\\nThese two hippocampal activity modes can be seen in primates as well as rats, with the exception that it has been difficult to see robust theta rhythmicity in the primate hippocampus. There are, however, qualitatively similar sharp waves and similar state-dependent changes in neural population activity.[118]\\n\\nHippocampal theta rhythm\\nMain article: Theta wave\\nExample of a one-second EEG theta wave\\nThe underlying currents producing the theta wave are generated mainly by densely packed neural layers of the entorhinal cortex, CA3, and the dendrites of pyramidal cells. The theta wave is one of the largest signals seen on EEG, and is known as the hippocampal theta rhythm.[119] In some situations the EEG is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10\\xa0Hz, often continuing for many seconds. These reflect subthreshold membrane potentials and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons and synchronize across the hippocampus in a travelling wave pattern.[120] The trisynaptic circuit is a relay of neurotransmission in the hippocampus that interacts with many brain regions. From rodent studies it has been proposed that the trisynaptic circuit generates the hippocampal theta rhythm.[121]\\nTheta rhythmicity previously clearly shown in rabbits and rodents has also been shown in humans.[122] In rats (the animals that have been the most extensively studied), theta is seen mainly in two conditions: first, when an animal is walking or in some other way actively interacting with its surroundings; second, during REM sleep.[123] The function of theta has not yet been convincingly explained although numerous theories have been proposed.[112] The most popular hypothesis has been to relate it to learning and memory. An example would be the phase with which theta rhythms, at the time of stimulation of a neuron, shape the effect of that stimulation upon its synapses. What is meant here is that theta rhythms may affect those aspects of learning and memory that are dependent upon synaptic plasticity.[124] It is well established that lesions of the medial septum\\xa0– the central node of the theta system\\xa0– cause severe disruptions of memory.[125] However, the medial septum is more than just the controller of theta; it is also the main source of cholinergic projections to the hippocampus.[19] It has not been established that septal lesions exert their effects specifically by eliminating the theta rhythm.[126]\\n\\nSharp waves\\nMain article: Sharp waves and ripples\\nDuring sleep or during resting, when an animal is not engaged with its surroundings, the hippocampal EEG shows a pattern of irregular slow waves, somewhat larger in amplitude than theta waves. This pattern is occasionally interrupted by large surges called sharp waves.[127] These events are associated with bursts of spike activity lasting 50 to 100 milliseconds in pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1. They are also associated with short-lived high-frequency EEG oscillations called \"ripples\", with frequencies in the range 150 to 200\\xa0Hz in rats, and together they are known as sharp waves and ripples. Sharp waves are most frequent during sleep when they occur at an average rate of around 1 per second (in rats) but in a very irregular temporal pattern. Sharp waves are less frequent during inactive waking states and are usually smaller. Sharp waves have also been observed in humans and monkeys. In macaques, sharp waves are robust but do not occur as frequently as in rats.[118]\\nSharp waves appear to be associated with memory.[128] Numerous later studies, have reported that when hippocampal place cells have overlapping spatial firing fields (and therefore often fire in near-simultaneity), they tend to show correlated activity during sleep following the behavioral session. This enhancement of correlation, commonly known as reactivation, has been found to occur mainly during sharp waves.[129] It has been proposed that sharp waves are, in fact, reactivations of neural activity patterns that were memorized during behavior, driven by strengthening of synaptic connections within the hippocampus.[130] This idea forms a key component of the \"two-stage memory\" theory,[131] advocated by Buzsáki and others, which proposes that memories are stored within the hippocampus during behavior and then later transferred to the neocortex during sleep. Sharp waves in Hebbian theory are seen as persistently repeated stimulations by presynaptic cells, of postsynaptic cells that are suggested to drive synaptic changes in the cortical targets of hippocampal output pathways.[131] Suppression of sharp waves and ripples in sleep or during immobility can interfere with memories expressed at the level of the behavior,[132][133] nonetheless, the newly formed CA1 place cell code can re-emerge even after a sleep with abolished sharp waves and ripples, in spatially non-demanding tasks.[134]\\n\\nLong-term potentiation\\nSee also: Long-term potentiation and Sleep and learning\\nSince at least the time of Ramon y Cajal (1852–1934), psychologists have speculated that the brain stores memory by altering the strength of connections between neurons that are simultaneously active.[135] This idea was formalized by Donald Hebb in 1949,[136] but for many years remained unexplained. In 1973, Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo described a phenomenon in the rabbit hippocampus that appeared to meet Hebb\\'s specifications: a change in synaptic responsiveness induced by brief strong activation and lasting for hours or days or longer.[137] This phenomenon was soon referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP). As a candidate mechanism for long-term memory, LTP has since been studied intensively, and a great deal has been learned about it. However, the complexity and variety of the intracellular signaling cascades that can trigger LTP is acknowledged as preventing a more complete understanding.[138]\\nThe hippocampus is a particularly favorable site for studying LTP because of its densely packed and sharply defined layers of neurons, but similar types of activity-dependent synaptic change have also been observed in many other brain areas.[139] The best-studied form of LTP has been seen in CA1 of the hippocampus and occurs at synapses that terminate on dendritic spines and use the neurotransmitter glutamate.[138] The synaptic changes depend on a special type of glutamate receptor, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a cell surface receptor which has the special property of allowing calcium to enter the postsynaptic spine only when presynaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization occur at the same time.[140] Drugs that interfere with NMDA receptors block LTP and have major effects on some types of memory, especially spatial memory. Genetically modified mice that are modified to disable the LTP mechanism, also generally show severe memory deficits.[140]\\n\\nResearch\\nA brain implant for use as a hippocampal prosthesis has been the subject of research since the early 2000s.[141]  It was reported in 2018 that a nonlinear multi-input multi-output model (MIMO) had been developed that in some studies, had been shown to restore and improve memory function.[142] This has been followed by a modified version known as the memory decoding model (MDM).[143] This model has been shown to have the potential use in significant modification of memory. A study concluded that further research could be pointed towards an evaluation of both models, in particular focusing on the hippocampal theta wave input.[144]\\n\\nClinical significance\\nAging\\nSee also: Neurobiological effects of physical exercise §\\xa0Structural growth, Aging brain, and Memory and aging\\nNormal aging is associated with a gradual decline in some types of memory, including episodic memory and working memory (or short-term memory). Because the hippocampus is thought to play a central role in memory, there has been considerable interest in the possibility that age-related declines could be caused by hippocampal deterioration.[145] Some early studies reported substantial loss of neurons in the hippocampus of elderly people, but later studies using more precise techniques found only minimal differences.[145] Similarly, some MRI studies have reported shrinkage of the hippocampus in elderly people, but other studies have failed to reproduce this finding. There is, however, a reliable relationship between the size of the hippocampus and memory performance; so that where there is age-related shrinkage, memory performance will be impaired.[145] There are also reports that memory tasks tend to produce less hippocampal activation in the elderly than in the young.[145] Furthermore, a randomized control trial published in 2011 found that aerobic exercise could increase the size of the hippocampus in adults aged 55 to 80 and also improve spatial memory.[146]\\n\\nDementia\\nIn Alzheimer\\'s disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to be damaged;[147]\\nshort-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Amyloid beta deposits begin in the frontal lobes before the signs of neurofibrillary tangles are seen in the hippocampus.[148] Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may cause anterograde amnesia: the inability to form and retain new memories. \\nDementia is very often caused by cerebral ischemia that is believed to trigger changes in the hippocampus. Changes in CA1, the hippocampal area that underlies episodic memory, cause episodic memory impairment, the earliest symptom of post-ischemic dementia.[149]\\n\\nStress\\nThe hippocampus contains high levels of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas.[150] There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of other parts of the brain.[151] These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder,[152] and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia[153] and severe depression.[154] Anterior hippocampal volume in children is positively correlated with parental family income and this correlation is thought to be mediated by income-related stress.[155] A study has revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.[156]\\nChronic stress resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids, notably of cortisol, is seen to be a cause of neuronal atrophy in the hippocampus. This atrophy results in a smaller hippocampal volume which is also seen in Cushing\\'s syndrome. The higher levels of cortisol in Cushing\\'s syndrome is usually the result of medications taken for other conditions.[157][158] Neuronal loss also occurs as a result of impaired neurogenesis. Another factor that contributes to a smaller hippocampal volume is that of dendritic retraction where dendrites are shortened in length and reduced in number, in response to increased glucocorticoids. This dendritic retraction is reversible.[158] After treatment with medication to reduce cortisol in Cushing\\'s syndrome, the hippocampal volume is seen to be restored by as much as 10%.[157] This change is seen to be due to the reforming of the dendrites.[158] This dendritic restoration can also happen when stress is removed. There is, however, evidence derived mainly from studies using rats that stress occurring shortly after birth can affect hippocampal function in ways that persist throughout life.[159]\\nSex-specific responses to stress have also been demonstrated in the rat to have an effect on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.[160][161] In rats, DNA damage increases in the hippocampus under conditions of stress.[162]\\n\\nPTSD\\nSome studies shows correlation of reduced hippocampus volume and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[163][164] A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans with no such symptoms.[165] This finding was not replicated in those with chronic PTSD, traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany).[166] It is also the case that non-combat twin brothers of Vietnam veterans with PTSD also had smaller hippocampi than other controls, raising questions about the nature of the correlation.[167] A 2016 study strengthened the theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus increases the likelihood of efficacious treatment.[168]\\n\\nTransient global amnesia\\nTransient global amnesia is a syndrome of unknown cause that results in a sudden and temporary anterograde amnesia and variable past memory loss. An attack usually lasts for up to 24 hours during which time the memory loss is experienced. The only diagnostic evidence of TGA is given by DWI-MRI that shows lesions as small dots in the CA1 subfield.[169][170]\\nThe lesions are detectable from around 24 to 96 hours after symptoms onset, and can be seen to have been resolved at  a six-month follow-up.[171] The lesions are between 1 and 5 mm, and can be single or multiple and may be confined to either  hemisphere.[169][170] Lesions in the dominant hemisphere affect episodic verbal memory and those in the non-dominant hemisphere affect visuospatial memory.[171]\\nCA1 lesions shows selective affect over other CA subfields.[172] The selective vulnerability of CA1 neurons suggests a cause of metabolic stress that could result from emotional or behavioral stress.[172][173] Other possible causes have been debated including cerebral venous reflex, arterial ischema, epilepsy, and migraine.[170] TGA as a network disease has also been put forward; DTI studies show a decreased connectivity between brain regions that may impact the hippocampus.[170]\\n\\nEpilepsy\\n An EEG showing epilepsy right-hippocampal seizure onset\\n An EEG showing epilepsy left-hippocampal seizure onset\\nThe hippocampus is one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated. This process of neurogenesis is confined to the dentate gyrus.[174] Neurogenesis can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures.[174]\\nSeizures in temporal lobe epilepsy can affect the normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage. Hippocampal sclerosis  specific to the mesial temporal lobe, is the most common type of such tissue damage.[175][176] It is not yet clear, however, whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures.[177] However, in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals, hippocampal damage is a frequent result. This may be a consequence of the concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. Hyperexcitability can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death.[158] It may also have something to do with the hippocampus being a site of continuous neurogenesis, and to abnormalities in this process.[174][158]\\n\\nSchizophrenia\\nA reduction in hippocampal volume is well reported in those with schizophrenia.[178][179] The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right.[180] The volume reduction is modest but consistent, and can be first seen in the prodromal stage with modest progression shown as the disease advances.[179] The reduced volume has been shown to be independent of treatment with antipsychotics. Some studies suggest that hippocampal alterations play a role in causing the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.[181][182] It has been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex.[183]\\nIn those with psychosis the greatest reduction is seen to be in CA3 and CA2 subfields, and a correlation has been made between the reduced volume and memory dysfunction.[179] A reduced hippocampal volume has been shown to result in a decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, with the declarative memory characteristic of hippocampal function becoming selectively impaired.[178] The impaired connectivity is evident both at rest and during task-activity.[179]\\nEvidence of dysfunctional GABA transmission  has been shown in studies of the whole hippocampus.[179] Another noted change in the hippocampus in schizophrenia is a reduced \\nM4 muscarinic cholinergic receptor, but an unaffected \\nM1 receptor.[179] Reduced neurogenesis has been shown in the dentate gyrus with a noted reduction in the density of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the dentate gyrus and hilus.[179]\\nHyperactivity in the hippocampus has been suggested to be implicated in schizophrenic psychosis.[179] The CA1 subfield is mostly indicated to be affected, and hyperactivity almost exclusively found in the anterior hippocampus.[179] It has been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex.[184] Many post-mortem studies have assessed the hippocampal subfield proteins. Evidence of hyperactivity was a consistent finding.[179] In CA1 BDNF (an indication of hyperactivity) was notably increased, but the synaptic protein changes seen in the other subfields were not affected.[179] The strongest change was seen in CA3 synaptic anatomy with an increase in the dendritic spines on the apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. This was most evident at the site of the entrance of the mossy fiber pathway to CA3 neurons. All three subfields have distinct molecular changes associated with schizophrenia.[179]\\n\\nMicrocephaly\\nHippocampus atrophy has been characterized in those with microcephaly.[185] Mouse models with Wdr62 mutations which recapitulate human point mutations show a deficiency in hippocampal development, and neurogenesis.[186]\\n\\nOther animals\\nOther vertebrates\\nNon-mammalian vertebrates lack a brain structure that looks like the mammalian hippocampus, but they have one that is considered homologous to it. The hippocampus, is in essence part of the allocortex. Only mammals have a fully developed cortex, but the structure it evolved from, called the pallium, is present in all vertebrates, even the most primitive ones such as the lamprey or hagfish.[187][188] The pallium is usually divided into three zones: medial, lateral and dorsal. The medial pallium forms the precursor of the hippocampus. It does not resemble the hippocampus visually because the layers are not warped into an S shape or enfolded by the dentate gyrus, but the homology is indicated by strong chemical and functional affinities. There is evidence that these hippocampal-like structures are involved in spatial cognition in reptiles, and in fish.[189]\\n\\nFish\\nIn teleost fish, the forebrain is everted (like an inside-out sock) with structures that lie on the outside, as contrasted with other vertebrate structures that lie in the interior, next to the ventricles.[190] One of the consequences of this is that the medial pallium, the hippocampal zone of a typical vertebrate, is thought to correspond to the lateral pallium of a typical fish.[191] Several types of fish (particularly goldfish) have been shown experimentally to have strong spatial memory abilities, even forming cognitive maps of the areas they inhabit.[26] Studies in goldfish show that damage to both the lateral pallium, and the medial pallium impairs spatial memory coding.[192][193] It is not clear if the medial pallium plays a similar role in basal vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish.[194] The dorsolateral pallium of the teleost is considered as homologous to the hippocampus in terrestrial vertebrates.[195] In 2023, the goldfish brain was mapped by molecular parcellization showing that its telencephalon subregions were homogeneous to the hippocampal subfields in the mouse.[192]\\n\\nBirds\\nSee also: Avian pallium\\nIn birds, the correspondence is sufficiently well established that most anatomists refer to the medial pallial zone as the \"avian hippocampus\".[196] Numerous species of birds have strong spatial skills, in particular those that cache (store) food. There is evidence that food-caching birds have a larger hippocampus than other types of birds and that damage to the hippocampus causes impairments in spatial memory.[197]\\n\\nInsects and molluscs\\nSome types of insects such as cockroaches, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, suggesting that there is no common evolutionary origin. Mushroom bodies in insect brains are associated with learning and memory carried out in the mammalian hippocampus.[198] The brain of the octopus is arranged in a circle of lobes around the esophagus. The vertical lobe has been shown to be involved in forming long term memory, and is seen to be analogous to the mammalian hippocampus and cerebellum, and also to share some functional features of the mushroom bodies in insects.[199][200]\\n\\nSee also\\nVisual short-term memory\\nAdditional images\\n\\n\\n\\nHippocampus highlighted in green on coronal T1 MRI images\\n\\n\\n\\nHippocampus highlighted in green on sagittal T1 MRI images\\n\\n\\n\\nHippocampus highlighted in green on transversal T1 MRI images\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n This article was submitted to WikiJournal of Medicine for external academic peer review in 2016 (reviewer reports).
